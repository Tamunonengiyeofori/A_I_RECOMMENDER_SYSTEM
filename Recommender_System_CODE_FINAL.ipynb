However, the speakers were another matter. They wanted almost twice the price for these same speakers. After surfing Youtube, i found a tutorial that showed step by step instructions on how to install speakers into the Suburban doors. Might not be for everyone but I have a solid background in electronics, wiring, sodering, etc - so it was a snap to install and set these up. I bought the first pair for the front doors. The sound was drastically improved but there was muffled noise coming from the 2nd pair in the passenger doors - so I ordered a second set. Sound quality is now great in the truck (for anyone else attempting this - make sure you disconnect the sub in the back of the truck as it is a stock POS).

Superior bluetooth range, and interference when it does occur is not as \"busy\" as on the Momentums - instead of a series of dropouts and digi-noise as on the Senns, I usually only get a simple dropout of signal - much less annoying. Everything is improved a bit in wired mode, the bass is even better controlled, making them less warm while improving slam even more, midrange & highs also improve. Best ear pads ever - very deep and the foam forms a nice seal which is very effective for blocking outside noise (there is no Noise Cancelling in these as in the Momentums). Clamping force is very strong at first (which helps with the seal) which may be off-putting to some.

There is virtually nothing wrong with them beyond being every-so-slightly tight fitting.You are given the immediate sense you’ve purchased something special. The packaging is simple, elegant, and compact on the outside. Upon opening the box, the headphones are folded by themselves in a molded case. And what a great thing that is! Highlighting the design of the B&W P-line is essential to the overall experience, as there is nothing like them. Besides the use of high-quality materials (aluminum, sheep’s leather), the metal frame curves around the square-shaped full-sized ear cups in a graceful way. The hinges that allow them to fold more compactly are solid and industrial-feeling. The ear pads are attached magnetically to the cups, and gently pulling and removing them reveals the drivers beneath. The leather padding on the ear cups and head band is soft and thick. And adding to all of this tactile and visual joy is the smell of leather. It compliments the ‘first experience’ with them in a way that I’ve not had with other headphones.Pulling up a small tab on the molded case reveals a leather carrying pouch, a simple instruction manual, and a spare 3.5mm cable. That’s it. It’s simple and encourages one to get on with the reason why you made the purchase to begin with.If you were impressed by the design, the sound is only more so. It’s obvious there was a meticulous amount of attention in how sound is delivered through the P7s. There is a level of detail revealed here that is stunning to hear. Music comes to life in all frequencies of the sound spectrum. Lows are rich and punchy with no overt boom or distortion. Mids are exposed and centered enough to be able to easily hear without inducing ear fatigue. And highs are light, crisp, and full of detail. For being close-backed headphones, the sound stage is surprisingly large and open. There are times where it’s easy to forget you are wearing a set of headphones and not listening to a high-end stereo system in front of you. Part of this is due to how excellent the sound isolation is and part to how superbly well-delivered the audio is.It feels like B&W has gone to great lengths to make the P7s reproduce recorded audio the way an artist, producers, and engineers intended it to be heard. Instrumentation has an extremely high-degree of separation on almost every track I’ve listened to, the exceptions being on those recordings that were not great to begin with. And headphones like this allow for one to hear the extra dimension added from the environment where the recording was made. For example, if something was recorded in a small room, you can hear all of the audible nuances that come with recording in that small space. Symphonic music feels rich, huge and detailed. Rock albums feel aggressive and full of attitude. Electronic, jazz, contemporary, industrial…you name it, these headphones faithfully reproduced audio in ways that continually surprised me. This is refreshing, as it highlights the fact that so many consumer headphones add ‘filler’ to their signature. In other words, accuracy of the music is not the end-goal; selling a certain kind of sound associated with the headphone is. This is fine if you enjoy one or two particular types of music, but the limits become apparent when you go outside of that box.While on the pricey side, the B&W P7s are worth every penny, as they are in a class all their own.

            "[(\"I really liked these and wanted to keep them because they make one heck of a first impression but I ultimately had to return them. Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new, genuine leather. From the thick headband to the ear cups, this baby is soft, premium leather all the way. The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they're not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them. Here's my first comparison to it's peers. Most every other set, even over $300 is almost completely plastic. This is solid metal and leather through and through and it's heavier than its competitors for it. That's already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag. It's obviously a higher quality product with better materials. I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached. Should there be an unrepairable break or tear, just buy a new set and pop them on. Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches. This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in. You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design. The picture doesn't do these justice. They impress from top to bottom. One thing they don't look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms, sweltering heat and storm season outdoors. They're also softer than they look. The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they're very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded. I also like the added thickness on top. They did feel good at first when I put them on, but I felt some discomfort during my hours of wearing them. The clamping pressure started to make my upper jaw, under my ear ache. They seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise. They're easily the best noise isolating headphones I've ever put on. They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case, making them more portable. The ear cups don't swivel though.I'll be honest here about the sound. I have to say, I came away disappointed. They don't sound bad by any means but they're warmer in the mid range that I like which sacrifices some of the treble that I'm used to. I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X's, they didn't blow them away, which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation. I then realized that it wasn't a realistic expectation because my M50X's are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage. I thought the P7's would outperform them so well that I'd just ditch them completely. That didn't happen. In fact, I'm now convinced that it's probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these. If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, Sony, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have. My M50X's are just a notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them. These are a different flavor altogether. The mids and lows are much more pronounced, pushing vocals to the forefront. Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music. Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention. Cello's, harp's and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me. Bass kicked electronic music (Daft Punk, Deadmau5) up a few notches over my AT's as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious. I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I'm not a bass head so I don't want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either. It sounds like it's getting close to the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there. I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT's can do very well. Most of the bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7's which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches. I prefer a V shaped sound, favoring the treble and bass. In fact, I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ's, so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums. I also couldn't distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars. On a particularly heavy song, the high hat cymbal was almost completely drowned out and it took my M50X's to remember how much I should be hearing it. The extra emphasis on the mids and bass made the sound fuller but muddied the separation. The P7's made most everything sound better and outperformed my M50X's just not it the rock category which is a big one for me. They came up short according to my tastes. Headphones originally priced at $400 shouldn't have such a glaring weakness. They should do everything really well but don't. That was the main reason why I had to let them go.Outside of music, the P7's also worked well with T.V. shows and movies. Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience. The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable. My M50X's held their own while doing a direct comparison though.There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad. The cord even feels better in comparison to others I've felt. A drawback is the included case. While it's nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones, I'm not a fan of soft cases. Especially not for expensive electronics. It'll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you're going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently, I'd have my reservations. These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls, drops, getting sat on or being crushed by other bags. The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife's make-up bags which is a bit of a turn off. That's a very minor gripe though.In conclusion, these are premium, luxury headphones. The look like it, feel like it, smell like it and but come short of sounding like it which is what matters most to me. If you've already invested in a decent set of headphones, they won't completely redefine portable listening for you but they'll provide you with a quality product that's physically head and shoulders above everything else I've seen on the store shelves.I still do recommend these for people who want a premium build and appreciate warmer sounds. For heavy vocals, stringed instruments, and almost everything else, they're still very good. Hard rock is their achilles heel though. I'm just like hearing that separation amongst the distortion. I now have a greater appreciation for my M50X's though. Going head to head against a high end headphone like the P7 and coming out on top is pretty remarkable and even though it was a tough decision, that was the main reason why I couldn't keep them. I just couldn't justify paying $300 for a set of headphones that didn't completely outperform my M50x's, are actually lacking the treble that I like and hurt from the extra clamping force. But they sure are nice looking.\", 'NN')]\n",

            "[(\"Man, do these make one heck of a first impression. Removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new, genuine leather. From the thick headband to the ear cups, this baby is soft, premium leather all the way. The metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that they're not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them. Here's my first comparison to it's peers. Most every other set, even over $300 is almost completely plastic. This is solid metal and leather through and through. That's already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag. It's obviously a higher quality product with better materials. I also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached. Should there be an unrepairable break or tear, just buy a new set and pop them on. Underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches. This is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in. You can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design. The picture doesn't do these justice. They impress from top to bottom. One thing they don't look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms, sweltering heat and storm season outdoors. They're also much more comfortable than they look. The ear pads are filled with memory foam so they're very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded. I also like the added thickness on top. While they did feel a little clampy when I first put them on, I never felt any real discomfort during my hours of wearing them. They also seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise. They're easily the best noise isolating headphones I've ever put on. They fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case, making them more portable. The ear cups don't swivel though.I'll be honest here about the sound. I have to say, I was a little disappointed at first. I cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my Audio Technica M50X's, they didn't blow them away, which is what I was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation. I then realized that it wasn't a realistic expectation because my M50X's are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage. I thought the P7's would outperform them so well that I'd just ditch them completely. Well, that didn't happen. In fact, I'm now convinced that it's probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these. If you have a good set already that's at least over $100 to $200 and up by well established companies like Sennheiser, V-Moda, Beyerdynamic, Bose, Audio Technica, etc. (intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated Beats), the P7's won't completely redefine good sound for you. At least they didn't for me. Once I got over that, I focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what I already have. My M50X's are just a slight notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something I like about them. These are a different flavor altogether. The mids and lows are much more pronounced, pushing vocals to the forefront. Beck was practically singing right in front of my face when I played some of his music. Stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention. Cello's, harp's and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me. Bass kicked electronic music (Daft Punk, Deadmau5) up a few notches over my AT's as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious. I really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but I'm not a bass head so I don't want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either. It sounds like it's right on the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there. I like a lot of rock music too which is something my AT's can do very well. A few bands actually sounded better on them than on the P7's which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches. I prefer a V shaped sound, favoring the treble and bass. In fact, I usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my EQ's, so I missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums. I also couldn't distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars. The push to the mids made the sound fuller but muddied the separation a little more. For most everything, The P7's did everything better and outperformed my M50X's. They just came up a little short a few times according to my tastes.Outside of music, the P7's also worked great with T.V. shows and movies. Vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience. The extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable.There are 2 cords provided and the one attached for Apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my iPad and iPod. The cord even feels better in comparison to others I've felt. My one drawback is the included case. While it's nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones, I'm not a fan of soft cases. Especially not for expensive electronics. It'll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if you're going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently, I'd have my reservations. I'm ordering a hard case for just such uses. These are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls, drops, getting sat on or being crushed by other bags. The included soft case also looks more like one of my wife's make-up bags which is a bit of a turn off. That's a very minor gripe though.In conclusion, these are premium, luxury headphones. The look like it, feel like it, smell like it and sound like it. If you use or have already invested in a decent set of headphones, they won't completely redefine portable listening for you but they'll provide you with a quality product that's head and shoulders above everything else I've seen on the store shelves. I probably would've had some buyers remorse had I paid the original $400 asking price for these but at $280 on Cyber Monday, it would take a lot to convince me that there's a better made and sounding headphone than the B&W P7. This is one of those rare times where getting what you pay for turns out to be a good thing. Highly recommended for music listeners and those who appreciate a little luxury every now and then.*Note: After Cyber Monday, the P7's went up to $350 which looks like their new standard asking price. That still seems like a pretty good deal and keeps them at the top of the heap in that price range.\", 'NN')]\n",

I have bought and used sets from all categories and pricepoints, including professional musician in-ears meant for stage performance, and those meant for recording studio monitoring and producing records.When I saw this set of headphones for half off, I quickly ordered them.

I spend most of the work day in a laboratory, not at a desk. Maybe this is a suitable product for those whom are allergic to getting their hands dirty.It was my oversight that this set only has 40mm drivers. The lack of bass response shows this, especially at higher volume. I have an extremely capable pair of audio technica ATH-ESW9 that way outshine this set without breaking a sweat.These headphones are also lacking a fwd/rev skip button to move to the last or next track.

Ads will not be disappearing any time soon, and my cheap motorola behind the neck bluetooth headphones from years back have this feature!

They have a really nice display that worked which went a long way. If you have been to stores sometimes this is not the case.Before I tried them on I did a quick Google search for some details and it came up with all the of marketing splash, it is all words until you try them out in my opinion. What struck me initially trying them on is the seal around the ears. They are very comfortable on the ears and seal very well. After wearing the headset for about an hour it starts to fatigue the top of the head. Looks like they chose to make the ear the comfortable spot which is fine.The audio sounds great, comparable with the beats in a good way. I am not a fan of the sound of the Bose headphones, they have that Bose sound which is like audio Doritos, always the same consistent sound but never blows you away lol. The NXTGEn Active Noise Cancelling technology is very interesting. Having come from Bose I had very high expectations and I would say that JBL has met those expectations and exceeded them in a few key ways, namely the Ambient Awareness. This feature is cool in that it allows you to hear what is going on around you to a degree based on preference. This would have been perfect for studying with my cohort back in school when you wanted to kill all of the background non-sense but wanted to still be able to hear someone crack a joke or ask an interesting question on a tough problem.I think one of the coolest parts of this product is the app that you can download. I did not even know about it until I Googled it and it makes all the difference. You can set your own EQ, turn On/Off the Noise Cancel and set the level of the Ambient Aware independently for each each with is great. The hearing in my left ear sucks from driving with the window down all the time so it is nice to customize to each ear.I attached some pictures of the app. One of the other cool things which I still do not understand how they do it but it is called TruNote. I guess it measures your head and tunes the headphones for it. I really like this feature as I usually am wearing glasses of some kind so this really helps when they are on. I did an A/B comparison with it on and off it the music was especially clear when I used the TruNote calibration.The built-in mic is okay but it seems like it is too far up on the headset for it to be really legit.

Though not a new type of product, in this day and a age it is still a first from JBL offering a headphone with a well-rounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenarios.The packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents. The Elite 700s is nicely presented in a cut out. Once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located. This pouch is primarily good for scratch protection, as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage. Kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps. Beneath the box is the one button standard 3.5 to 2.5mm auxiliary that can allow the Elite 700 to be used passively in case the battery dies. Next up is the micro USB cable to charge and/or sync the Elite 700 to a computer to update the firmware. Lastly, we have the warranty and quick start guide documentation.The comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly. Ear pad diameter opening is also adequate; however, the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the Elite 700 to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of use.On the bottom right ear cup you can find the 3.5mm input jack, the micro USB charge and sync port, as well as the built-in microphone. Turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button, which can either toggle on and off ANC or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom. Moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button, the play/pause, answer/hang-up phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down button.The Elite 700 has a companion app, which can be downloaded free from the App store or Google Play store. Functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive. You can quickly toggle on and off the ANC as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you. It can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low, medium or high or off. You can adjust the frequencies in this EQ area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own. Moving back, you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the Elite 700 will trigger. Lastly, you can activate TruNote, which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum, and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsI am just going to get straight to the point and say it. The Elite 700 is as of today my favorite overall headphone and I never expected them to be. I was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in BestBuy and having respect for JBL as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as I figured hey, I have a 30-day return window, whats there to lose? Well, these are the first Bluetooth headphones I have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential. The wireless mode alone is simply excellent. The ANC does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution, but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven. The ANC ability of the Elite 700 is roughly close to the QC25, but not quite there. With ANC off, these sound great. Because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance, I really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response, but in stock, they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm, very slight. I will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off, the bass is tight, quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass. It does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my V-MODA Crossfade Wireless can handle with ease, but overall the Elite 700 has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the Crossfade Wireless. The Elite 700 conveys a midrange that is open, clean, articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes I truly cannot believe I am using a wireless headphone. No wireless headphones that I have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity, none. Treble once again is clean and if I had to nitpick, it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the Bowers & Wilkins P7 or Fidelio L2. For a wireless headphone, this is honestly quite amazing. When the Elite 700 is wired, they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables I have heard in terms of resolution and clarity. From the stellar 15-23 hour battery life, to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way I want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has rocketed these unsuspected headphones to the top of my recommendation list.', 'NN')]\n",

It\\'s a Best Buy exclusive, so no other sites carry it.Read the reviews here... Most are very positive. Few negative ones. All in all, not enough to dissuade me.So I bought them.Let the disappointment begin.First, the Packaging is horrible. it\\'s almost impossible to open the box and take everything out without at least tearing some of the paper off with all the tape. Not a huge deal... but for high cost items, I like to try to keep in intact.Next packaging problem: How to take the headphones out. Turns out there are 2 small clear plastic pieces of adhesive right over the metal on the band. Couldn\\'t tell it was plastic to be removed until I had to force the first one out.Ok. Frustrating but, not a big deal.The \"quick start\" documentation is pretty horrible. They show you the buttons, but they don\\'t describe what they are for.. Maybe I\"m not aware of the ISO symbol for LED or for the \"Smart\" button.Finally turn them on, and they went into paring mode (white/red LED flashing). Search on my phone. Nothing. turn them off, turn them back on.. same thing. Manual doesn\\'t describe what the various flashing lights mean (both LEDs flash white? Red LED flashes twice?) Finally I resorted to their website. Found a FAQ on how to pair with a new device (Power button for 16 seconds). YAY. IT finally pairs.I anxiously fire up my Google Play Music app to hear music. The first 5 seconds it crackles, pops, and drops out and back in. After that, they sound pretty good.. Maybe it was just that start up. Hit the next track button. Same thing. First 5 seconds are horrible, then it settles down.OK.. Maybe it\\'s the app. You Tube. Same problem (if not worse).So, now getting annoyed. $300 headphones and all these challenges? Maybe it\\'s other cell/wifi traffic that\\'s interfering. So, go into airplane mode, and turn on ONLY blue tooth. Crackle crackle drop crackle.So, last ditch effort, I decided to see just how good the ANC/Ambient noise was. So... No music. Just changed settings for the ANC. The room was already reasonably quiet, but I put on the TV with talking just to see how well it filtered it out (just like a chatty plane passenger might be). Switching between the 3 levels, and turning them off, I could hear a difference in the tone quality, but between off, and max, I couldn\\'t tell as much difference between them. Not like my Bose headphones were NOTICEABLY muted the first time I turned those on (wired, not Bluetooth).Lastly, when reaching for the \"smart\" button, I bumped the micrphone right near that button. It was a very pronounced mic pickup. If I was wearing a coat with a hood or something, it would constantly interfere..I\\'ve paired my Nexus 6P phone to multiple speakers and headphones, and never had any of these issues. Tomorrow, these go back. I would spend HOURS on the phone with support trying to address all these issues. And I\\'m not going to sit here and hope for a firmware update.All in all, I was very disappointed in these headphones. A friends Beats headphons (no ANC, just BT/over the ear) were much better from a refinement perspective. Hopefully over time, JBL/Harmon will improve both their documentation and their software, and their headphones. But for now, it is very much a \"first version\" type of headphones... not something that is worth $300...', 'NN')]\n",

The app works well and adds to the overall sound of the headphones. As of right now these are the best I have found available at Best Buy stores.Sound:I listen to a wide variety of music from rap to metal and everything in between. They have sounded great with every genre I have thrown at them. The bass is very clean and crisp not overpowering or drowning. The mids and highs are also excellent. The one problem I find with most headphones is the overall volume being too low. With these I find my comfortable listening level at only 1/2 the total volume instead of at full volume like the Xtra bass and Bose. The Beats were plenty loud but still did not sound as good overall. I purchased the Sony Xtra Bass because they sounded great in the store display but when I got them home it was nothing like in store. On the other hand, the store display does not do these headphones justice. They sound much better than the display units.(The sound quality does take a hit when you plug them in directly to a device but not enough to take anything away from my rating.)Bluetooth:The range is excellent. I can leave my phone in one room and move around the house from room to room completely with little to no drop off. I have not tested the distance with a clear line of sight but I'm sure it's as advertised. They only pair to one device at a time but I have not had any issues pairing with my iphone or computer.Noise Cancelling:The passive noise cancelling alone is pretty good due to the thick padding in the ear cup however, this pair of headphones has active noise cancelling which work very well. I can easily drown out the sound of the kids while they play just dance in the same room. This is my first experience with ANC so I really don't have anything to compare them to. I do not get that bluetooth/noise cancelling hum that some have referred to in their reviews.Comfort:The JBLs are very comfortable with their large ear cups and soft padding. They take a adjusting to find that perfect fit but once you find it you are good to go. I have done about four hours straight while doing homework and they have been awesome. They don't get hot and do not cause sweating either.Overall these headphones are a little on the heavy side but that by no means is enough to take away from the comfort and what these headphones can do which is produce awesome sound.\", 'NN')]\n",

            "[(\"In theory, these are a really great set of over-the-ear headphones. They combine wireless BT connectivity with the option for wired, active noise cancellation with Ambient Aware' (let's you let in a certain amount of outside sound), a cool sounding built in 'calibration' technology, and it's all made by a well-respected brand name in audio. In execution, it doesn't quite live up to what I would have expected for $300+ There are better (and less expensive) options out there. They don't sound bad and the build quality is great. But I'm of the opinion that they aren't worth the price.First, the good. They're easy to set up and pair with your device They are solidly constructed. They are fairly comfortable (initially) for how heavy they are, and the ear cups are contoured nicely for a better fit around your ear. Out of the box they sound acceptable, and once you download the app and tweak the EQ, it starts sounding much better (especially once you turn off the noise cancellation).But there are so many little annoyances.These are not something that I'd ever choose to bring out in public. For being a wireless mobile device, they're really bulky. They don't start off uncomfortable at all, but they get there after about 30-45 minutes of use. You will notice the heat and, if you have a sensitive head, crown pressure.JBL Harman touts a technology called TruNote that supposedly analyzes the position of the drivers in relation to your ears, making the sound better due to personalization. This is run through the app. You put the headphones on, run TruNote (which plays one quick tone similar to an Audessey auto-EQ setup on a Denon receiver), takes a few seconds to calibrate, and then moves on. I cant say that I noticed a dramatic difference between when I ran it and when I didnt.Speaking of the aforementioned app, you have to download it in order to optimize your listening experience. It allows you to do several things, including running TruNote, turning noise cancelation on/off, and tweaking the Ambient Aware & EQ settings. The one that will likely get the most usage is turning the noise cancelation off and tweaking the EQ.Note I said turn noise cancelation off. The sound quality improves fairly dramatically with it off. In my opinion, its average execution of noise cancelation, so its worth it to have off. The ear cups provide ample noise isolation as it is, but if youre going to pay for noise cancelation, you should be able to use it without affecting the sound negatively.The EQ is where youll get the most dramatic performance increase, as it allows you to adjust 3 bands each (total of 9 bands) within the low, medium, and high frequency sound spectrum. In fact, I would say this is absolutely essential in order to get the most out of the headphones. As mentioned earlier, they sound acceptable out of the box but lack some kick out of the bass and the mids start to get tinny when increasing the volume. There are 3 presets and then you can customize and save different personal settings. I like all of this in theory. Different EQ settings for different types of music is great, but objectively, a common listener may not want to mess with thisespecially since you have to open the app every time to do this. And to be clear, you dont HAVE to open the app to get the headphones to work; but you have to open the app to take advantage of the noise cancelation, the EQ, etc.Its great that you can use the headphones wired when they run out of power. This also increases the sound quality. But what happens when you want to use them wired AND still have power AND want to use the app (to have access to the EQ)? That does not seem possible. Once you go wired it defaults to shutting off the bluetooth connection. And if you reconnect it defaults to sending sound wirelessly.When youre not listening to music you can use the headphones for phone calls. Call quality is average.Finally, its worth mentioning a couple sets of controls on the back of the left and right cups. On the left there are volume controls + play/pause. On the right there is the Bluetooth power/connect button and a smart button that is assignable (via the app) to either adjusting the level of Ambient Aware (low, medium, high) or noise cancelation on/off. These are great and convenient additions, but you have to keep in mind that when you need to adjust the headphones on your head (and you willsee the previously mentioned uncomfortable after extended use comment), youll likely hit these buttons. Its not a big deal, but it requires some behavior change.All of these small annoyances led me to a return.I understand that these are supposed to be more professional / higher-end headphones for people who also want a wire-free experience and mobility. But somewhat complicated, unintuitive, and unnecessary features should not outweigh the primary goal, which is mobility. The bulky design and weight would immediately disqualify them.

Could they have failed this hard? Well, the answer is yes and no. If you know how to use the app corectly, it is very useful and improves the quality of music tenfold. Jbl doesn't make any of this crystal clear; first off, the app ONLY works for the elites, and I'm told the reflects as well, have only tried the elites with the app. Second, for the app to recognize your headphones they MUST be connected through Bluetooth. Not the aux cable. If you are wanting to utilize the app through a wired pair, then I'm not really sure why you picked up a wireless set of headphones. Also in order to connect through Bluetooth wirelessly, the aux cable cannot be plugged into the headphones. The App is 4.8 stars for me. Improves the quality of music, and people who have given 1 star rating don't understand how to use the app. CONS: So far, not many. I will, however make you as informed as possible. The Fit - Headphone comfort varies from person to person, but to me they are very comfortable and snug fit. They do press on your head a bit but I prefer it, better passive noise cancelling against background noise. Size - They are a bit big, but they do fold up, and they come with a case as well. When Wired: When the battery is dead, the headphones still work with a wire (included), the App does not work, nor the awesome features of the headset. Sound goes to mediocre. Could be better, but I rarely plug them in because of 18-20 hr. battery life. Overall, 4.8/5 starsHope my review helps you make a decision for the better.

I used my iPod to get some decent music and the JBL was the only one to sound natural to me with no overwhelming basses and highs. The mids were average, it sounds like something is missing in the mids...The ANC is the most annoying thing in these wireless headphones as it muffles a lot the music but a good point for this model is that the ANC is not as strong as the Bose quiet (I could not cope the white noise of the Bose models) and best of all, it is possible do disable it via the JBL app or the press of the smart button once programmed.Another drawback is the weight of this thing, it is very heavy for a headphone and the ear cups are too small which brings some discomfort on the long run.I do not know if my headphone has an issue but I could notice very strong and annoying scratch noises when using the headphone outdoors with ANC on while weather was a bit windy. Disabling ANC removed the issue.The JBL app is a must, it is easy to use and most settings are available at hand: trutone setup, noise cancel, ambient awareness power and balance and the jewel... the EQ settings. 4 default settings are available: Off, Jazz, Vocal, Bass + the possibility to create our own EQ settings.The smart button can be programmed to act as ANC on/off or ambiant awareness power via the app which is very convenient.The app provides also the possibility to upgrade the firmware of the headphone via bluetooth which is convenient even though I wished JBL discarded some information about the upgrade itself (what does it fix/bring?)Regarding the pouch provided, I wished JBL gave some information as I discovered by accident that the headphone can be folded inward to fit the pouch.', 'JJ')]\n",

Now with that statement out of the way I was not very impressed with my overall purchase of the JBL Everest Elite 700 Headphones. There are some features that I did enjoy having, but there was a lot more that I was not very happy about.JBL Everest Elite 700Well start out with the positives about the JBL Everest Elite 700 headphones. The headphones them selves fit very snug on my head, but that also might very from person to person. Very comfortable to wear during a 4 to 6 hour event. They turned out to be lightweight even though they are a larger size of headphone. I really enjoyed the perfectly sculpted ear cushions. They cup the ears perfectly and block out most of the ambient sound.The JBL Everest Elite 700 features Bluetooth 4.1 and connects with ease every single time. The Bluetooth allows you to use the headphone built-in media controls on the edge of the left ear piece. JBL has also allowed use of the built-in microphones for hands free calling when paired with a mobile device like a BlackBerry, Droid, or iPhone. Now if you dont want to use or cant use the Bluetooth feature they do come with a 3.5mm jack cable.JBL Everest Elite 700 is also powered by a built in rechargeable battery that will last 15 amazing hours, so there are no worries about running out of power mid set. They charge up with the use of a micro USB port on the bottom of the right ear cup. The JBL Everest Elite 700 has built in auto off sensors to preserve that amazing 15 hour battery as well.JBL Everest Elite 700Now onward to the nitty-gritty. JBL has packed them with NXTGen Active Noise Cancelling. Its a cool feature and concept, but as for DJ use its not needed and if you get the basic JBL Everest 700 it can save you $100 USD. When spinning with this feature on I did notice the headset speakers bottoming out. This made it very annoying when trying to pick out specific sounds during a mix.I feel like the structure of the JBL Everest Elite 700 could have been a lot better. Spending $300 USD on headphones they need to feel like they will last and not snap apart when you take them on and off. JBL might have done this to gain the lightweight feel or just to save money on construction. If I used these for one tourist season outside everyday I dont for see them making it all the way through. A plastic head band is not the best possibility on such a premium headphone.JBL also has listed Smart Technology: Personalize your listening experience via the MY JBL Headphones app on the box. This app is not compatible with MANY devices and judging by the many bad app reviews it doesnt even function or work correctly. Again if a company is going to push such a high dollar product they need to get everything corrected ASAP.JBL Everest Elite 700So overall from my standing point as a professional DJ the JBL Everest Elite 700 is a massively overpriced full plastic headphone with okay sound and features.', 'NN')]\n",

Ive tried the best (Bose 350 dollars for like match to JBL) and the worst to find the JBL outstanding for 240+ dollars.

These are well built, and are flexible for the many different sizes of heads out there. Mine is tiny, so these can look a little goofy on me, but for the average head, they will look just fine! The reason you would buy these though, would be for the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and its price point versus Bose. At 240 dollars, these are awesome. At 300 dollars (normal price) I would say its up to the individual if they want to save for the higher priced competition. The ANC is good, but not perfect, and compared to Bose, do not cancel out all of the noise. But what I like about these are the ability to bring 2 different levels of outside noise into the headphones which is nice when your walking around the airports all day and want to avoid collisions. And while the ANC is not the best, at 240+ dollars, you really cant go wrong. The best about these? They can be updated VIA the app!

            "[(\"I was looking for nice over the ear wireless headphones. I read tons of reviews and everything was leading me to the Bose QC35. After listening to them in the store, I was impressed with the richness of the sound, but didn't really want noise cancelling (I've got a pair of Bose in ear for that purpose and those are simply the best at blocking out unwanted sound...much better than the QC models IMHO). They didn't block out a lot of noise in the store and the noise cancelling seemed a bit overbearing. I started trying different models in the store and literally stumbled upon the JBLs. It didn't take long for me to be totally impressed with the sound quality and full richness of the sound. I was going to the the non-ANC model, but they were out of stock. This one was close in price so I splurged a bit. I'm glad I did. ANC - it's really not that useful. I does block out some ambient sound while music is playing and gives a bit more focus to the music really. Does it drown out voices or other louder noises? No. This is very minimal effect. The nice thing is that the music sounds precisely the same with it on or off. The ANC can easily be switched off while preserving the sound quality. If anything I'd say the ANC might clean up the music a bit, but it's not so processed that it changes the sound. For louder volumes, you'd be hard-pressed to tell if it's on or off. If you're looking for serious noise cancellation, this is not the one to get. The packaging is very nice and top notch. As a surprise, there is a carrying case included. Just a pouch and not hard sided, but a nice pouch that is not at all cheap looking or feeling. Kudos for that. The sound - it's great! Really great! Full and rich and not at all processed sounding. It's really nice. Deep bass, clear highs. Really can't tell that this is not plugged in as the sound is superb. Even at full volume, there is never any punch to the base, just a nice low rumble. The highs never screech, but get delivered with nice clarity. The mids and voices are clear and right where they should be. JBL did this right. The app on the phone has preset equalizer settings, or you can create your own custom profile (more than one). The bluetooth has great range and doesn't skip a beat. The battery percentage shows up near the bluetooth icon on my iPhone. It paired quickly and without any issues. I just got these a few hours ago so can't really comment on the battery life just yet. Plugged in with the included cable, the sound is exactly the same so far as I can tell. That is - as long as they are switched 'on'. When switched off, they will work, but there is a drop in quality. When a cable is plugged in, bluetooth is shut off immediately. When the cable gets unplugged, bluetooth switches back on right away and it re-connects with the phone. The size/weight is a lot. These are not small and can be a bit heavy resting on the top of your head. The padding is there but could be more to alleviate some pressure. Could just be me as I've not had over the ear headphones in a long time, but worth mentioning here. Another really nice thing is that with the app, I could update the firmware over bluetooth. I think previous models were windows pc only, but this updated easily and without a problem. Some have said that the lag when watching videos is terrible. Must have been a firmware thing because there is positively no lag at all. After just a short amount of time I'm quite impressed and happy with my purchase. Not so sure about the white color, but for some strange reason is a lot less in price over the black ones so I saved the money. At BestBuy they have a display where you can plug in your phone and listen to your own music or a pre-set playlist on the display. I HIGHLY recommend doing that and comparing the same songs or videos with multiple models. Forget these reviews as sound is highly subjective. Just don't pass these up as they really are a very nice yet may be overlooked for Beast or Bose.\", 'NN')]\n",

The battery last the day and charges up pretty quickly. Just be sure you actually turn them off before putting them in the case or you will be disappointed when trying to use them. They are supposed to have an auto off feature, but I did find my headphones at 10% after a full charge and in the case for 2 days. Maybe the battery doesn't hold a charge for very long. I figured it was in the box at the store for longer than that and was fine out of the box when I tried them that first time before their first full charge.

Though not a new type of product, in this day and a age it is still a first from JBL offering a headphone with a well-rounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenarios.The packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents. The Elite 700’s is nicely presented in a cut out. Once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located. This pouch is primarily good for scratch protection, as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage. Kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps. Beneath the box is the one button standard 3.5 to 2.5mm auxiliary that can allow the Elite 700 to be used passively in case the battery dies. Next up is the micro USB cable to charge and/or sync the Elite 700 to a computer to update the firmware. Lastly, we have the warranty and quick start guide documentation.The comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly. Ear pad diameter opening is also adequate; however, the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the Elite 700 to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of use.On the bottom right ear cup you can find the 3.5mm input jack, the micro USB charge and sync port, as well as the built-in microphone. Turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button, which can either toggle on and off ANC or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom. Moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button, the play/pause, answer/hang-up phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down button.The Elite 700 has a companion app, which can be downloaded free from the App store or Google Play store. Functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive. You can quickly toggle on and off the ANC as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you. It can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low, medium or high or off. You can adjust the frequencies in this EQ area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own. Moving back, you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the Elite 700 will trigger. Lastly, you can activate TruNote, which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum, and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsI am just going to get straight to the point and say it. The Elite 700 is as of today my favorite overall headphone and I never expected them to be. I was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in BestBuy and having respect for JBL as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as I figured “hey, I have a 30-day return window, what’s there to lose?” Well, these are the first Bluetooth headphones I have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential. The wireless mode alone is simply excellent. The ANC does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution, but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven. The ANC ability of the Elite 700 is roughly close to the QC25, but not quite there. With ANC off, these sound great. Because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance, I really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response, but in stock, they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm, very slight. I will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off, the bass is tight, quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass. It does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my V-MODA Crossfade Wireless can handle with ease, but overall the Elite 700 has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the Crossfade Wireless. The Elite 700 conveys a midrange that is open, clean, articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes I truly cannot believe I am using a wireless headphone. No wireless headphones that I have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity, none. Treble once again is clean and if I had to nitpick, it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the Bowers & Wilkins P7 or Fidelio L2. For a wireless headphone, this is honestly quite amazing. When the Elite 700 is wired, they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables I have heard in terms of resolution and clarity. From the stellar 15-23 hour battery life, to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way I want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has rocketed these unsuspected headphones to the top of my recommendation list.', 'NN')]\n",

            "[(\"In theory, these are a really great set of over-the-ear headphones. They combine wireless BT connectivity with the option for wired, active noise cancellation with ‘Ambient Aware' (let's you let in a certain amount of outside sound), a cool sounding built in 'calibration' technology, and it's all made by a well-respected brand name in audio. In execution, it doesn't quite live up to what I would have expected for $300+ There are better (and less expensive) options out there. They don't sound bad and the build quality is great. But I'm of the opinion that they aren't worth the price.First, the good. They're easy to set up and pair with your device They are solidly constructed. They are fairly comfortable (initially) for how heavy they are, and the ear cups are contoured nicely for a better fit around your ear. Out of the box they sound acceptable, and once you download the app and tweak the EQ, it starts sounding much better (especially once you turn off the noise cancellation).But there are so many little annoyances.These are not something that I'd ever choose to bring out in public. For being a wireless mobile device, they're really bulky. They don't start off uncomfortable at all, but they get there after about 30-45 minutes of use. You will notice the heat and, if you have a sensitive head, crown pressure.JBL Harman touts a technology called TruNote that supposedly analyzes the position of the drivers in relation to your ears, making the sound better due to ‘personalization’. This is run through the app. You put the headphones on, run TruNote (which plays one quick tone similar to an Audessey auto-EQ setup on a Denon receiver), takes a few seconds to ‘calibrate’, and then moves on. I can’t say that I noticed a dramatic difference between when I ran it and when I didn’t.Speaking of the aforementioned app, you have to download it in order to optimize your listening experience. It allows you to do several things, including running TruNote, turning noise cancelation on/off, and tweaking the Ambient Aware & EQ settings. The one that will likely get the most usage is turning the noise cancelation off and tweaking the EQ.Note I said ‘turn noise cancelation off. The sound quality improves fairly dramatically with it off. In my opinion, it’s average execution of noise cancelation, so it’s worth it to have off. The ear cups provide ample noise isolation as it is, but if you’re going to pay for noise cancelation, you should be able to use it without affecting the sound negatively.The EQ is where you’ll get the most dramatic performance increase, as it allows you to adjust 3 bands each (total of 9 bands) within the low, medium, and high frequency sound spectrum. In fact, I would say this is absolutely essential in order to get the most out of the headphones. As mentioned earlier, they sound acceptable out of the box but lack some kick out of the bass and the mids start to get tinny when increasing the volume. There are 3 presets and then you can customize and save different personal settings. I like all of this in theory. Different EQ settings for different types of music is great, but objectively, a common listener may not want to mess with this…especially since you have to open the app every time to do this. And to be clear, you don’t HAVE to open the app to get the headphones to work; but you have to open the app to take advantage of the noise cancelation, the EQ, etc.It’s great that you can use the headphones wired when they run out of power. This also increases the sound quality. But what happens when you want to use them wired AND still have power AND want to use the app (to have access to the EQ)? That does not seem possible. Once you go wired it defaults to shutting off the bluetooth connection. And if you reconnect it defaults to sending sound wirelessly.When you’re not listening to music you can use the headphones for phone calls. Call quality is average.Finally, it’s worth mentioning a couple sets of controls on the back of the left and right cups. On the left there are volume controls + play/pause. On the right there is the Bluetooth power/connect button and a ‘smart’ button that is assignable (via the app) to either adjusting the level of Ambient Aware (low, medium, high) or noise cancelation on/off. These are great and convenient additions, but you have to keep in mind that when you need to adjust the headphones on your head (and you will…see the previously mentioned ‘uncomfortable after extended use’ comment), you’ll likely hit these buttons. It’s not a big deal, but it requires some behavior change.All of these small annoyances led me to a return.I understand that these are supposed to be more ‘professional’ / higher-end headphones for people who also want a wire-free experience and mobility. But somewhat complicated, unintuitive, and unnecessary features should not outweigh the primary goal, which is mobility. The bulky design and weight would immediately disqualify them. And the fact that you have to do some work to get them sounding right takes them even further out. If you're an audiophile, your primary use is at home, and you just want a pair of wireless headphones (because as an audiophile you are likely using wired connections all the time), these would probably work (though I think there are better options). These are not a great option for a common listener, as you likely want to just throw the on, connect, and go.\", 'NN')]\n",

Now with that statement out of the way I was not very impressed with my overall purchase of the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 Headphones. There are some features that I did enjoy having, but there was a lot more that I was not very happy about.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700We’ll start out with the positives about the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 headphones. The headphones them selves fit very snug on my head, but that also might very from person to person. Very comfortable to wear during a 4 to 6 hour event. They turned out to be lightweight even though they are a larger size of headphone. I really enjoyed the perfectly sculpted ear cushions. They cup the ears perfectly and block out most of the ambient sound.The JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 features Bluetooth 4.1 and connects with ease every single time. The Bluetooth allows you to use the headphone built-in media controls on the edge of the left ear piece. JBL® has also allowed use of the built-in microphones for hands free calling when paired with a mobile device like a BlackBerry, Droid, or iPhone. Now if you don’t want to use or can’t use the Bluetooth feature they do come with a 3.5mm jack cable.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 is also powered by a built in rechargeable battery that will last 15 amazing hours, so there are no worries about running out of power mid set. They charge up with the use of a micro USB port on the bottom of the right ear cup. The JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 has built in auto off sensors to preserve that amazing 15 hour battery as well.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700Now onward to the nitty-gritty. JBL® has packed them with NXTGen Active Noise Cancelling. It’s a cool feature and concept, but as for DJ use it’s not needed and if you get the basic JBL® Everest™ 700 it can save you $100 USD. When spinning with this feature on I did notice the headset speakers bottoming out. This made it very annoying when trying to pick out specific sounds during a mix.I feel like the structure of the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 could have been a lot better. Spending $300 USD on headphones they need to feel like they will last and not snap apart when you take them on and off. JBL® might have done this to gain the lightweight feel or just to save money on construction. If I used these for one tourist season outside everyday I don’t for see them making it all the way through. A plastic head band is not the best possibility on such a premium headphone.JBL® also has listed “Smart Technology: Personalize your listening experience via the MY JBL Headphones app” on the box. This app is not compatible with MANY devices and judging by the many bad app reviews it doesn’t even function or work correctly. Again if a company is going to push such a high dollar product they need to get everything corrected ASAP.JBL® Everest™ Elite 700So overall from my standing point as a professional DJ the JBL® Everest™ Elite 700 is a massively overpriced full plastic headphone with okay sound and features.', 'NN')]\n",

            "[(\"As I travel almost weekly for work, I have plenty of opportunity to wear these out, and I can say that so far (3 months in) they are working out well. My 3rd purchase of 200+ dollar headphones, I wanted to try out the 3 major brands in competition, and these are so far the best sub 300 dollar headphones you can buy with ANC. Ive tried the best (Bose 350 dollars for like match to JBL) and the worst to find the JBL outstanding for 240+ dollars. ( bought these on sale )  The JBL headphones are comfortable, but not as light as the Bose, but still, they don't weigh down your ears or top of head after 2+ hours of use. These are well built, and are flexible for the many different sizes of heads out there. Mine is tiny, so these can look a little goofy on me, but for the average head, they will look just fine! The reason you would buy these though, would be for the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and its price point versus Bose. At 240 dollars, these are awesome. At 300 dollars (normal price) I would say its up to the individual if they want to save for the higher priced competition. The ANC is good, but not perfect, and compared to Bose, do not cancel out all of the noise. But what I like about these are the ability to bring 2 different levels of outside noise into the headphones which is nice when your walking around the airports all day and want to avoid collisions. And while the ANC is not the best, at 240+ dollars, you really cant go wrong. The best about these? They can be updated VIA the app! Meaning that JBL can fix or update anything related to the headphones without having to physically upgrade over time. While I'm not alone on my opinion related to the ANC, (seems most tech reviews state the same thing,) I would still recommend these at the price point I paid!\", 'NN')]\n",

After charging my phone fully, the battery pack drains quite fast when not in use. I started to recharge my phone tonight & although it charged at first, I noticed my phone suddenly began losing the charge. I figured that the battery pack had drained while in the drawer, so I plugged it in to charge it, & after 1 hour, the battery pack still had a red light on, felt quite hot, & the charger at the point where it is plugged into the wall, was so hot it alarmed me, something that had never happened when charging my phone. I immediately removed it, with the red light on the battery pack still on, & decided to see if I could see just where things stood. I plugged my phone into it & saw a temporary green light. Then nothing. My phone is charging slowly but who knows what will happen next. Some are saying they've gone on day long adventures, away from local plug in availability, & had no problem losing power to their devices. I'm in my own home & can only get 1 charge on 1 occasion, & a burning hot charger on another occasion. This device is absolutely serving no purpose whatsoever, as I can charge my phone on the charger that it came with. If this thing won't hold it's own charge, unused, for more than a couple hours, what's the point? Totally useless in an emergency. What a waste of money. And it's too late to return it. So I'm stuck with a piece of junk & am out $43. It was on sale for $40....now the sale price is down to $30. Piece of junk.....maybe just a lemon, but this is very discouraging & I have to say don't bother.

Coming from another Harmony remote, the initial setup was very simple with a few tweaks for preference and new capability. I say that acknowledging I am something of a geek and understand the basics of how remotes work and their limitations. Even for the technologically challenged, Logitech has done a good job of making the programming interface intuitive and easy to use but still powerful enough for advanced users to customize. If anything, it errors on the side of simplicity vice functionality.Some of the biggest concerns I had was the fast-forward/skip button since the two functions have been combined into a single button with this remote. I was quite leery of this as a DirecTV customer but happy to report that with a bit of tweaking and use of the gestures this is completely a non-issue. Only shortfall I can complain about is the lack of immediate access to the number pad- you can swipe left/right to it but I would prefer to map a soft key to bring it up. Niggling issue that may be possible but I haven't found an easy way to do it just yet.The biggest complaint and the area where Logitech misses the mark is (as others have pointed out) with the basic ergonomics. The hard buttons are great, the touch screen is great and the overall size of the remote is great, they just need to re-organize! Put the touchscreen at the very top and move the transport controls (FF, pause, record, play etc.) under the screen! It would even benefit from being slightly longer to allow the main controls to sit just above center (where your thumb naturally sits) and fit better in the hand. I complain about this, pointing out this is a great unit that could benefit from a refresh- same functionality in a slightly different package.To wrap this up, I am VERY pleased with this remote overall. It is not perfect and could use a change to the basic layout BUT it is a SOLID unit that is very flexible and a pleasure to use.

If I were a teenager this conundrum might be interesting, but as it is, I do not have lots of spare time to tinker with problems caused by engineers who release products that are not ready for prime time. Oh and by the way Logitech keeps more or less banker's hours, i.e., Monday through Friday 8 to 5 so forget about tech support unless you don't have a job.By way of comparison, it used to take me 20 minutes to program the Harmony One, with the Ultimate One and 2 hours into the project, all I can control is the volume on the AV amplifier.Wish I had never had reason to make an acquaintance with Ultimate One, unless you have lots of time to kill I recommend that you avoid it and wait for next iteration of Harmony remote, or seek alternative company's remote if available.As piece of hardware, the Ultimate One may have promise. If I get out of the woods with the software, I will post the results.Addendum: 04/19/14: OK, now that the remote is programmed, I love this remote! Overall I prefer Logitech products (e.g., Razer mouse, K400 illuminated wireless keyboard, Squeezebox Touch, Harmony One), no design is perfect given that compromises are always necessary, but I tend to prefer their solutions, so I have high expectations. As for the Harmony Ultimate, I like the form factor including the decreased size from the One (perhaps the DVR buttons should be on the bottom but it does not bother me as it does others) and the flexibility and power of the programming is a definite leap forward. I haven't yet tried the onscreen leap forward/jump back buttons, but if I don't like them, I can always program two of the colored buttons at the bottom to perform those functions. For me it was not that hard to program, I just needed to take a break after all the initial frustration when the software would not install.If it were not for the install glitches I would give the Ultimate One a 5 out of 5 stars. As my experience got off to such a rocky start and others may not own computers with a variety of Operating Systems in order to troubleshoot MyHarmony software install issues (and lack of evening/weekend technical support) 4 stars is is as high as I can go.I believe seamless compatibility with Win7 should be a given, although I suppose you could try and blame Windows, but for a company as widespread as Logitech it seems they should be able to do a lot better. FWIW the Win8.1 computer is not my favorite, but I purchased it a year after Win 8 was released in order to attempt to keep up with the times, and this is the second occasion it has come in handy i.e., when my daughter had to do violin tests for public middle school orchestra, the Smart Music app failed with an incomprehensible error, same problem with only daytime M-F tech support, and no searchable threads to explore any solutions. So we installed SmartMusic on the new all in one portable Win 8.1 Dell and never looked back, problem solved.10/12/14 Still mostly love this remote, my vote remains 4 1/2 stars.In case it hasn't already been answered via other threads, the DirecTV jump forward/back button functions (approx 30 sec forward, 7 seconds back, if memory serves) do still exist on this remote but they are indeed hidden by an Android-style tap versus press/hold gesture, i.e., tapping the FF or RW button brings up the fast forward/rewind functions, e.g., 1-4 taps equals 1-4 times speed for FF/RW, whereas press/hold brings up the jump forward/back functions (with a vibrate signal to indicate success in accessing the press/hold feature, so you know when to let go, found these functions by accident one day when I pressed and held the buttons a bit too long, one second I suppose).My only real gripe with this remote now is that occasionally I press the power off button when I am trying to press the rewind button it would be nice if the power button was a bit more physically isolated from the RW button if you don't watch TV every day sometimes your tactile grasp of where the buttons are on the remote is less secure, and you really don't need to power off without having to look at the remote.Bottom line and in contradiction of other reviews regarding the tactile layout of the remote: it is still excellent without need for visual guidance once you learn the layout and compares well to that of the Harmony One (really, who needs physical number buttons when you're watching DVR) and easy to operate, even if you are working out on an elliptical machine while watching TV, I might add.\", 'NN')]\n",

Boom, just like that all my devices were set up. However, we just got an AppleTV, and as one might guess, it was a breeze to set that up too.For those that don't know, you enter your devices on the website, then create activites based on them. For example you have a tuner, a TV, a cable box, a game console, a Bluray player, and an AppleTV: for Watch TV:, you use the TV, the tuner, and the cable box. You let the Harmony know the HDMI (or other input) on the TV, that the tuner gets switched to cable/sat. Then the activity becomes, turn on the TV and make sure it is switched to the proper input, turn on the tuner and switch it to the proper output, and turn on the cable box. When you hit the off button all get turned off. Say while watching tv you want to watch a movie. Then the cable box gets turned off, the Bluray player gets turned on and the tuner switches its output mode to Blu ray/DVD. Same for gaming, radio, etc.After the unit is programmed your remote situation goes to a single remote and touch-screen goodness.My woman loves them. One remote, so no clutter.

(it takes just the right touch.) however, i just love the gesture screen controlled by swipes taps. i wish it had the ability to be controlled by two fingers also, so i had 22 instead of 11 gestures, but the screen is a bit cramped for that (and it requires the hub and a smartphone which is overkill for my purposes), i reprogrammed 4 of the 11 (and use the buttons instead), several of which control the input of my PC in the bedroom (making this old Sony HDTV semi-smart w/ a wireless keyboard and mouse).the adjustable vibration feedback when you complete a command is simply splendid. there are also about 10 different screen backgrounds to choose from. you can even upload a pic when it is plugged into the computer and create one's own wallpaper/backgrounds.my major gripe about these Logitech remotes ( remotes in general), and i have had two before this one, is the buttons wear out, before the electronics, and they will not sell the keypad. i am a retired electronics technician, so i am capable of prying apart the old 650 and replacing it. (a classic example of planned obsolescence.) this is part of the reason i went the extra mile and got this and i am happy i did. (of course the main button that went bad controlled the Dish, and was one of the four around the little screen that are not mappable, so i could not transfer it to another.) this model is tight as a clam, and they claim the rechargeable lithium battery should never need replacing. well, it may last longer than i do, but all batteries eventually need replacing. the little stand that it recharges in, either by micro USB, or AC/DC voltage converter w/ micro USB is great. in no time one gets into the habit of putting it back in the stand, so one is less likely to misplace it, and it doesn't take very long to recharge. the 650 ate batteries for breakfast!this was refurbished/recertified, and came w/ a QC sticker on it. i got it elsewhere, and it looks and functions brand new. Logitech handles it w/ a warranty like it is a brand new one, and i don't think i am imagining this: their customer/tech service seems to have improved from what i remember. 80+ is a bargain, when one considers the retail price of a new one. this was refurbished/recertified, came w/ a QC sticker on it, and i obtained it elsewhere. it looks and functions as if brand new, off the shelf.

            "[(\"I've had a love/hate relationship with Harmony for the past 10 years...but no more second chances.Just like every Harmony I've ever owned, setup for this required a call to tech support. I'm fairly tech savvy, and this should be easy to set up, but it wasn't. And I know it wasn't me because it took tech support 30+ minutes and 7 syncs to make it function properly. Yes, properly is in quotes because even at its best, it was unimpressive.On my own using the software, syncing failed to load my activities into the remote. And again...it took tech support 7 syncs to make it work.Even after it was working properly, it was still frustrating to use:1) When switching between TV and SMART TV, it would power the speaker bar on and off. Does Logitech not understand that TV and SMART TV are not 2 separate devices and if you are switching from one to the other the sound should be left on With a remote this expensive I shouldn't have to dig out the speaker bar remote to turn it back on every time I switch activities.2) Lack of physical buttons for numbers is annoying. Any time I need the number pad I have to swipe to unlock, then swipe to get to the number pad. Technology is supposed to make processes faster...not slower. And yes, I know I can turn off the lock feature...but then every time I grab the remote it does something I don't want, and that something usually requires time-consuming troubleshooting.3) As I mentioned before, programming this remote is a nightmare (2+ hours) and even then it couldn't stand alone. I ran into problems only tech support could solve, and even then it took 30 minutes AFTER I had all the correct devices loaded. Please note that this was a simple configuration: Sony smart TV/Fios DVR/Samsung speaker bar. All less than 3 years old. After I returned this remote I bought a learning remote and endured programming every single button individually, and it still took a fraction of the time.4) There is no POWER button. Only an OFF button. You turn things on by selecting an activity. And as stated before...switching to a new activity powers things off that a remote this expensive should understand should be left on. If you are going to have a single OFF button that powers down everything with an activity button that turns everything back on, you should have an ON button for each device so you can quickly turn on any device that for whatever reason doesn't turn on when you fire up the system with an ACTIVITY button. And again...having to do an initial swipe to get to the ACTIVITIES just to turn the system on is annoying. Why does Logitech insist on writing code that slows down the power-on process5) You cannot utilize the Harmony software without plugging in the device. Why When things aren't working correctly (which is often) we should be able to fire up the app just to review the settings. Then, when you do plug the remote in, you have to wait for the remote and your PC to establish communication. Don't software engineers understand that we HATE waiting for technology to do things Especially when forced to plug in when we don't want to Speaking of plugging in, it is difficult with this remote. First off, there is a totally unnecessary door. That door gets in the way when you're trying to plug in, and plugging in is difficult enough already because the mini-USB port is deeply recessed inside the door. Do we really need to cause all this hassle just to hide a mini-USB port C'mon Logitech...don't you guys own cell phones Mini-USB doors are annoying and useless (which is why cell phones stopped using them). Try to keep up.6) Tech support is only good for 90 days. Based on my experience with this remote and 2 previous Harmony remotes, this means that any changes I make to my very simple home entertainment system will not work, and I will not be able to get help to make them work.A remote that costs well over 100 should assimilate my entertainment system like the Borg.

            "[(\"Honestly, this remote is pretty great. Some argue about how the play/pause buttons are at the top but I had no issue using it that way. Besides, most of what I tried let's me use the Ok and directional buttons as play/pause, fastforward/rewind. The touch screen is pretty responsive and there isn't much delay accessing your devices or activities. What sucks is that there is a limitation of 15 device no matter if you add more of these remotes or add a hub, you'll get the maximum amount from the device that has the maximum limit. I wish the 8 device limit from my harmony hub combined with this harmony remote giving me a total of 23 devices. But nope Logitech just wants you to buy one of the expensive remotes to have the 15 limit. Even the Elite has a maximum of 15. So the maximum you could get from the most expensive remote is also 15. They should have at least doubled that as they did with the 8 limits.Before I begin, I would like to say this is my first time owning a smart universal remote. I had one or two or so cheap universal remotes before. So this is a bigger difference.Battery: Charge it for four hours. Use it for about 72 hours. Plenty of time to use this imo. Just leave it on charge when you sleep and you'll be good to go throughout the day. It has a charging indicator on the screen that let's you know when charging and fully charged. There is a battery life indicator on the top right of the screen when the remote is out of lock screen. You can charge this two ways. It has a cradle but you can also use the micro USB port below the remote to charge it up. (The micro USB port is mostly just there to setup the remote through PC but you can charge it through micro USB port as well.)Design: The remote looks beauitful. Though, it could have been better. I do agree with people that the play/pause, fastforward/rewind buttons should have been at the bottom. But honestly that isn't an issue as most of the stuff I've tried lets you use the directional and ok button as play/pause, fastforward/rewind. But either way it's pretty easy to use and feels nice in the hands. I love having a remote that has both a touchscreen and physical buttons. Touchscreen adds more functionality and having physical buttons just feels better pressing on them. Number keys would have been nice but really not needed if you have ditched cable and don't plan on having an antenna. And it doesn't take much effort looking at the touchscreen when entering the numbers. I know some people don't like that but at least it's just 9 numbers and not an entire alphabet. :)Interface: Not much could be done with an interface when the screen is small. It's nice for a universal remote (much better than what smart universal remotes had before). You can change the background from a preset or upload your own through the computer. Overall, it's pretty easy to use and really no delay from going device to device.Touch screen: Like I mentioned before, the touch screen is pretty responsive. If you don't want to accidentally touch the touch screen, it's best to put the lock screen. So you can just swipe the lock screen when you want to use it and you don't accidentally end up pressing any of the touchscreen buttons when you meant to touch the physical buttons etc.Customization: You can arrange the order of devices. For example if you want TV all the way at top you can drag it to all the way at the top when you are in edit mode. Same with activities. What you can't arrange is Smart Home devices that are in the Plug/Lights folders. You can arrange where Plugs and Lights go but not the devices themselves in the Plugs and Lights folder. Kinda sucks as you can do that with the Harmony app but not on the remote. Also, the arrangement you set in the Harmony app doesn't get applied to the remote. You have to do the arrangement separately on both the app and remote. Also as I said before you can also change the background image to a selection from the preset or upload your own through the computer. Customization is great but could be better. At least it's there. :)Activities/Favorites: You setup activities which lets you can turn on multiple things at once. You can also for example access your favorite channels or if you have a Roku your favorite apps. It seems like there is only integration with Roku when it comes to Alexa and Favorites section. So for example you can launch Netflix from the Netflix icon in the favorite sections once you hit the Roku activity.Limitations: It kind of sucks that there is a device limitation of 15 devices only. I'm sure they could have gone with a much higher limit. I have a IR+RF Hub called Broadlink RM Pro that doesn't have this kind of annoying limit and it's much cheaper than this remote and harmony hub. It's only under 40 and that's when it's not on sale. I also wish they would have let us combined devices in order to increase our limits such as if you have the harmony hub which carries only 8 devices you'll have 8 + 15 from this harmony remote giving you a total device limit of 23. The nice thing though is there does not seem to be a limit of devices you can setup for SmatHome such as if you have SmartThings linked, you can pretty much put as many devices as you like.Price: It's a pretty expensive remote. It's hard to put 200 on this remote. I guess if I paid 200 for this remote, I would have rated this differently. But since I got this during the holidays for 100, it's a much better experience to me just because of that.Support: Logitech has email, live chat and phone support. So you have many options to chat with them. And they usually respond back and take care of your problems pretty well.Overall: I would recommend this product when it's on sale for 100 or less. As 200 is too much to ask for. I like this over using a smartphone as a remote because it's nice having a device that is dedicated as a remote only and nothing else. Smartphones have too much going for it and the lack of physical buttons don't make it as nicer to use as a dedicated remote. Even if you voice control for everything (Echo/Google Home), using a remote is sometimes nicer. I prefer changing the volume through remote rather then through Alexa but I prefer turning on the TV through Alexa through anything else. The amount of customization is nice but could be better. Having the ability to charge the remote two ways (Micro USB and cradle) is also nice. The remote has a nice design, feels good in the hands but the device limitations are for the most part the weakest point. I could get away with the other issues as they aren't such big issues but I would have loved to control more devices without having to find workarounds. Overall, I would recommend this remote only when it's 100 or less. I can't see myself putting 200 for any remote. (But who knows maybe I will)\", 'NN')]\n",

First of all, let me state that I was on the fence after reading the reviews here on Amazon, but I took the plunge and so far I'm not regretting it. This is my first Harmony remote, so I obviously can't make comparisons with previous models which might have been better than the unit presently under review.It took me 30 to 45 minutes to set up and sync my new remote through the Harmony software. That was a breeze, but it's important that you know your system and how its individual components are connected to each other. All my components were supported by the remote, so no problems there. I was able to customize the background image on the touchscreen. A nice touch, though not very important.Once the first sync from software to remote is completed, the remote will work on your system. As opposed to the previous situation, where you had four remotes lying around, you will now hit one button ('activity') and your TV, AV receiver and third component will turn on all at once. Great! At first this does not work flawlessly. For instance, you hit 'Watch TV' and everything might come on, but the AV receiver won't be on the right channel. The great thing about this remote, though, is that it learns on the job: It will ask you if the function performed as desired, and if not, how it can improve. After my initial use with every component, these flaws were pretty much ironed out. I now have a perfect remote with no issues whatsoever.One downside to all this automation is that the Harmony cannot predict when you've been fooling around with your equipment behind its back. Turned off your TV by hand using that device's own power button The Harmony doesn't know, so when you switch everything off through the remote (again: just ONE button), your TV will come back on again. You can work around this by customizing the color buttons on the bottom of the remote to be separate power on/off buttons for the individual components. You'll need to customize these buttons for every programmed activity, so there's an initial time investment involved. And of course there are no markings for these functions on the remote, so you'll have to memorize everything. All in all this is not ideal.If you want to nitpick, a few other minor cons are: 1) the sluggish touchscreen and 2) slightly flimsy buttons. This is nothing I can get worked up about.None of the downsides mentioned above can put a damper on my excitement. I'm very happy with this product. I'm still a tiny bit worried about the negative reviews and, subsequently, the longevity of this remote. Time will tell, and I'll adjust my rating if this thing fails within the first year or so. So far I'd highly recommend it. Great product!\", 'NN')]\n",

For instance, the touchscreen locks after inactivity, so you can easily press buttons above the screen without worrying about accidentally pressing commands on the touch screen. I also love that I can change per-device command delays, screen brightness and button backlighting. It's also worth noting that the picture shown includes older firmware. The newer firmware looks more modern and sleek, and like it's predecessors, can control the Xbox One and Xbox 360. I couldn't get my old remote to do that. The dock is also pretty cool.That said, there are a few cons:- The top buttons are a bit awkwardly placed. They can be hard to get to.- The remote comes with a pre-set button-press delay of 0.1 seconds. At first, I thought the remote was just slow at processing commands, but it's actually a setting so you don't confuse older components. I wish it was more obvious so I would have changed it sooner to remove that annoyance.- There are no physical number buttons on this remote. This does not affect me as I do not have cable/dish/antenna, but for those who do, this could be an annoyance.- This one's weird: I wish it were heavier. I'm coming from a Yamaha universal that came from my RX-V575 and was pretty great, and was also heavier. I wish this remote was heavier seeing as it's more powerful and much more expensive. If I'm going to spend 200+ on a remote, it should feel substantial in my hand.All in all, none of those cons were enough to remove even one star. This is (by far) the best remote I've ever owned.

In general, there are too few hard buttons (like HELP) requiring you to look down at the touch screen unnecessarily. In addition, the touch screen is not sensitive enough and frequently does not recognize taps. The swipe feature (which is nice in theory) is also not sensitive and often requires do-overs. After 4 months of babying (i.e., not letting the kids use it), the top half of the touch screen no longer worked at all. Subsequently found out that free technical support in the US is only available for 90 days (unlike Europe and Asia, which have 2 years and 1 year free phone support respectively). Without technical support, I was close to returning this, but with a little self-help persistence on the website, I was able to figure out how to reboot it (which solved the problem). Still, it should not have to be this difficult. Charging for technical support during the warranty period is a poor business model. Hope this company gets its act back together.', 'NN')]\n",

I purchased the new Ultimate One remote and installed the newer on line software. With this, I was able to set my remote up nicely. My old Harmony One worked but not as well as this new remote. My devices responded quicker and if it did not pick up a function the first time, I just selected Help and once it picked up that function, it actually remembered it from then on which the older remote did not do. I also bought the Hub. This is where my problems began. The Hub setup quite nicely with the new remote and actually made the remote work better, especially at longer distances. The only problem, at first, that I encountered was the Wi-Fi would not pick up so I called tech support. I have never had an issue with tech support within the 90 days allotted period but after 90 days you better have a credit card they will not help you, fact! Anyway, I was on the phone for over an hour and thirty minutes but they count not get the Hub to work with Wi-Fi so they escalated it up to level 2 support. She told me that they would contact me within 24 to 48 hours. That was around 11:30am on a Friday morning. Five days later on Wednesday around 9:05am I called them back requesting level 2 support. They told me that level 2 was busy and that they would call me back in just a few minutes. I heard nothing back that day. The next morning, Thursday, around 9:20am I called back and requested level 2 tech support. Mike told me that they were busy and that he would certainly have them call me back in a few minutes. At that point I told Mike that if level 2 did not call me back, that day, that I would be very upset. Mike said no problem and ended the conversation. Surprise! No call back that day either. So I called back on Friday morning around 10:20am and this time I was a little upset. I spoke to Kevin who read the notes from the day before and said he didn't understand why I was upset because the notes said that the second line tech was out on Thursday and that I was told that they would contact me on Friday. This was news to me. So it appears that Harmony tech support level one write down whatever note covers their butt but not necessarily the truth. Kevin said he would have a 2nd line tech call me right back. I said ok never thinking that I would ever receive a call back but to my surprise CJ called and we were able to start addressing the issues. After blowing out my perfect working remote, Ultimate One, and installing new software, firmware and the remote setup info the remote stopped working properly. The Hub issue was never fixed so I ended up calling Amazon, love Amazon, who offered me a refund or replacement.

I have a somewhat more advanced home entertainment setup with a AV receiver, Roku, DVD, and fairly new Motorola DVR from FiOS and this configured and handled them all perfectly - the first time I set it up.The genius of the product is that it's programmed online and Logitech has thousands of components already identified - and they allow you to check in advance if your devices are directly supported with a look-up utility on their site. I wasn't sure about my Pioneer VSX-33TX THX receiver as it's probably 10 years old, but it was no problem. You connect the remote to your computer, Windows 7 found the drivers online without issue, then go to the Logitech setup site and create an account if you don't already have one. Then you type in the model numbers of everything that you have. If your setup is simple that may be all you need to do, but they take care of multiple 'keypress' needs very elegantly. For example, to play a DVD I have to change the plasma display to HDMI 2, set the AV receiver to DVD input, then turn on the DVD. Logitech's setup anticipated the devices and the inputs that I'd probably be using so all I needed to do was to confirm and save. Then a single touch to the onscreen display on the Harmony does it all.Be aware that like most IR remotes, it wants a pretty straight line-of-site to the components and any glass in between will weaken the signal. My components are all in a cabinet with glass doors about 12 feet from our seating area and remote control wasn't a problem although it was necessary to be pointing fairly directly at the cabinet. If you're not sure about distances or want to be lazy when aiming, pick up and install an IR repeater and it will solve that problem.Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about this device. The ergonomics and setup are inspired and so human friendly that even my wife was impressed. The 200 seems expensive initially but if you consider programming a typical button-only remote can take hours and I had this set up in 15 minutes, it quickly seems like money well spent.\", 'NN')]\n",

When I think I have the problem solved the remote fails to perform a basic function like turning on or off my devices. Based on my experience this remote is not as easy as 1-2-3-4 to set up. This is a shame because the remote has some really nice features but all the great features in the world are of no value if the remote doesn't perform basic functions.You might wonder why not call customer service. I did and here is my experience. The bright spot about contacting customer service was that I was able to reach someone without waiting an hour to speak with someone. Also I called at 4:30 pm a half-hour before the service center closes and the customer serve rep worked with me past closing time. Bottom line was the customer service rep attempted to help me and went as far as remotely changing settings on the remote on-line which only made the problem worse. At one point I had to take a quick call and explained that I would put the rep on hold and be right back. As soon as I put the call on hold the rep hung up. No call back in case it was an accidental disconnect. I called back only to find the service center was closed. I was left standing there with my remote in my hand. A remote that did not operate. I was able to re-program the remote so it could operate albeit not properly.I can't recommend this product and urge you not to purchase this product. Clearly the product does not work as advertised and their customer service is pathetic. I will contact customer no-service this week when i have the time and update this review. But in the meantime don't waste your time or money on this remote.Update -We'll it has been almost a week since I wrote my review. Just to be clear none of my components or TV are concealed and well within range. Someone from Logitech contacted me via email (no phone). Unfortunately I am extremely busy during the week and could not speak to Ian Crowe although I did call Logitech in California and left a voice mail for Ian this afternoon. I tried to work with Logitech's customer no-service today. I spoke to someone off-shore somewhere. No help. In fact he tried to tell me my remote was an RF remote. Just to make sure this tech rep was wrong I called Vizio to ensure the remote was an IR remote. It is. Sadly I am still where I was last week. Sending me an email offering to help me is great but I need solutions not empty offers to help. Ian please call me.2nd Update - I have been working with Logitech's Senior Manager for Customer Service in the Bay Area, for the past two Fridays. It looks like the problem has been solved (crossing my fingers). I really appreciate the time and effort that Ian has made to make things right. Logitech is sending an optional hub to try in case the current fix does not work. If I have to return the remote Ian has promised a refund even if I return the remote after 30 days. I hope I don't have to use the hub or return the remote. If I have to return the remote it is not because of Logitech's not trying. I really believe that Ian has gone above and beyond what would be expected.The Bottom Line: This remote might be buggy depending on your AV equipment. But when it works, it works great. So far I really like using the remote. I especially like the favorites screen. I think my tech challenged wife will be able to use the remote too. Logitech has stepped up and helped make a bad situation a good one. I would recommend Logitech to a friend or family member. I changed the title of my review and gave the remote 3 stars from 1 star.

Worse yet the screen/pad isn't just dead space (honestly it would be better if it were), rather it's live. That can be ok when it's acting like a touch pad with various taps and swipes to do things (it never works that well, but I see what they're trying to do), but it's a disaster when it's live with functions that are so seldom used there's no dedicated button. So channel favorites, random superfluous functions, etc get accidentally pressed. Even then they hardly work in the case of the favorites with my Motorola cable box running Uverse (95 of the time 2 or 3 of the 4 digits are recognized). When you avoid that pad the other buttons are cramped and arranged poorly even within their poor locations. The 4 way pad is small, as are the play and pause buttons and the skip and fast forward buttons are shared. Of all the sacrifices made for the screen/pad, those red, green, yellow, and blue buttons you never use are still there--UGH!!!!!Move the screen up, move the key buttons where the fingers land, kill the color keyed buttons that don't ever do s***, and try again.

If you can follow simple directions, the application walks you through each step. I write instruction and repair procedures, and I can tell you that the instructions in the app make it easy to get the remote working how you like. well done, Logitech!You Begin by entering the brand and model number of each device. On one of the older devices it gave a screen message that there are control variations with that model and to consult them if there was a problem. It also popped up that the Roku was IR and RF and that this remote was only IR. It even handled an old VCR and a not-quite-as-old DVD recorder. Ya... we're old. So whatOnce all your devices are entered you create Activities. For example, for watching TV we use our receiver, the LCD TV and the antenna. It even asks if we wanted the Onkyo or the TV to control the volume and what input on the TV to use for this activity and what input on the receiver. I was easily able to create an FM activity to listen to the radio in the morning. With dreary morning eyes, just we only have to press the FM screen icon in the activities window on the touch screen.Additionally, I created two custom activities- one for watching HULU and one for watching NETFLIX using our Roku3. I was able to customize it so that the remote would start the TV, Start the Onkyo, and select the Roku. At that point it sent the signals to emulate remote key selections for HOME/Click Right/click Right/OK to get to Hulu. I did much the same for Netflix. I found that these two custom Activities would not go back and forth between the two. The solution was to add a two second delay between HOME and go right. The app made that easy as one of the custom items which could be selected in the app was ADD DELAY and you can select the length of the delay as well. Handy for troubleshooting should it become necessary. The custom items (such as the button presses) can be reordered when programming them as well. In that way, when I found the two custom Activities were not working properly I went back into the app, added a delay, and then moved the delay up to just after Home.If you are not sure, you can download the MyHarmony desktop software at the Logitech website and program in all the various devices to see how it works before even purchasing the remote.Although I gave it five stars, it is not perfect:- One problem I had with the last Harmony remote model and this one as well is that it is made to fit in your hand. Unfortunately, that same ergonomic design makes it very difficult to click something as simple as Mute when the remote is sitting on the table.- Allowing the application to auto-program the favorite channels will work fine for most people, but if you live in a rural area and get channels from different directions (like when using an antenna rotor), you can't automatically add the channels from both directions. Pick one or the other. The solution is to add the channels you watch manually, and that can be done right on the remote. Afterwards, synch the remote on the computer and they will be saved there was well.- Finally, the battery is not meant to be user replaceable, but a search on YouTube will show you that it can be done fairly easily, just in case the battery dies before the remote does.If I had known these things before I bought it, would it have changed my mind! No. I have been writing reviews in the coffee industry for nearly 16 years and try to be balanced in my appraisals. This is why I added the above.This model is evidently no longer for sale at Logitech, and I hope that this is not an indication that it is discontinued as that would be too bad.

            "[(\"I upgraded to this from a Harmony One, which I loved but was just starting to feel kind of old. I read a lot of reviews and complaints about this model's button layout. I figured people were just exagerating, how hard can it be to learn a new layout and get used to the play-pause controls being at the top of the remote instead of the middle. You have to hold the remote by the top to use the commands, but thats not the big problem for me. Instead its the brain dead designers that put the power button millimeters above the similarly shaped rewind button. The number of times I've accidently shut my whole system off while trying to quickly rewind something... extremely frustrating.Another issue with holding the remote at the top to use the play-pause controls is that your thumb or hand will often press the touch screen. This is a design flaw they tried to solve by putting a lock on the touch screen. When the touch screen activates you have to slide the lock screen over to use the touch buttons. This got old real fast, it adds an annoying extra step to trying to use your fancy (supposedly) convienent universal remote. Disabling the lock screen, however, means that my remote's touch screen is constantly ending up on the numeric or favorites page for some reason. Two pages I never use and wish I could just turn off or hide, but cant.And finally, the biggest problem with this remote. The battery. The Harmony One's battery lasted forever and when it was running low, the remote would smartly remind you to recharge it. This new Harmony lasts a few days if youre lucky, and has no charging reminder. So I'll use it for two days the battery indicator around 70, then the next days its completely dead and wont even turn on. So you cant use your remote until its gotten enough charge to function. If you remember to ALWAYS put the remote on the charger when youre not using it, this wont be an issue.

Yes, they do get daily work, but a little more in the build quality, especially for the steep price, seems warranted. Battery life on the previous models was also not good - I am talking about rechargeable models.Sadly, nobody makes as usable as a remote as Logitech/Harmony. If I am wrong please tell me in the comments - I am willing to switch!While easy to use, easy to set up is not the same thing. If you are tech savvy, it is not too difficult and the biggest challenge is first, getting all your correct model numbers for all your gear, second, knowing enough about how you have all this set up in terms of both audio and video inputs and outputs. Advice, write it down and keep it on file. That is a fair amount of work and takes some knowledge. Unlike my last model, the default button setup for this and my different devices was a bit off. I had to customize button settings for my cable box (FIOS) to properly use the Favorites guide and a few other things including On Demand - that's right, no default button set up for On Demand. In actual use my wife was able to start using it right away, but there are some quibbles here and there on having this be the only remote we need. Back to cable, but some often used functions, like search, are more cumbersome with this than the FIOS remote. We can live with it and let that stay in a drawer, but again, for 250 I think we can all demand a bit more thoughtfulness and user testing. Not to be AV elitist, but I don't think your average person with an average set up is going to shell out 250 for a remote. We want ease of use, but also versatility. FYI, I am running this with a HD TV, audio video receiver and a 5.1 surround setup, FIOS cable box, Roku 4, blueray DVD player and (for old family stuff I am working to convert) an actual VHS VCR!P.S. Swipe gesture thing is a gimmick and not very useful - volume buttons are easier to use. Would have much rather had the effort of this go into lower cost or functionality.

            "[(\"Almost a month ago I paid over 1,000 for four hub based Harmony Logitech Remotes: Two Ultimate Home remotes (one white and one black) and one Ultimate One upgraded with the Smart Control and Ultimate Hub add-on.I have three A/V systems - in my bedroom, home gym and family room. I used the Ultimate One + Smart Control combination in my bedroom so that my wife and I could each have a remote on our side of the bed that would stay in sync with each other.I must say that the units are beautifully packaged and have a very attractive design. They feel good in the hand. I am somewhat of a techie and have had various learning/universal remotes over the years, and did not find the setup difficult. In fact, compared to past remotes in which setup involved hours of button pushing, the Harmony setup was a breeze. I was very impressed by the GUI interface - though the process of adding/editing devices and activities was agonizingly slow at times because of the sluggish slow-mo response of the iOS app during the setup stage.I was so excited to set-up and deploy these remotes in the three rooms and happy to tell my family about the new convenience we would all enjoy - no longer having to juggle multiple remotes and devices in each room.Everything seemed to work perfectly running the remotes through their paces after installation.Unfortunately the honeymoon did not last long. The first night I really used the remote to watch a movie I noticed there were times when I tried to pause or rewind the playback, and the commands did not work - the remote was frozen-up. Then, 10 to 30 seconds later the commands I had given would be executed and the movie would start executing the commands - the movie would pause, rewind, etc. Since I had pushed the buttons repeatedly the result was somewhat comical as the TV seemed spontaneously to be pausing, fast forwarding, etc. as it executed the command I had given 30 seconds ago. This problem exhibited itself with the volume control and other controls as well.The next week and a half were a nightmare dealing with first level Harmony (off-shore) tech support personnel who repeatedly ran me through time-consuming standard troubleshooting scripts involving resting and reprogramming the remotes - firmware updates, submitting logs to them - all with no result.Finally after multiple calls and many hours spent, I was firm in demanding that the matter be escalated to upper level support personnel. At first these upper level support people would not talk to me directly - until I became very insistent that I had no interest in speaking further to the standard support personnel. (I must say, however, that every support person I talked to - and there were many - were extremely courteous - in a uniform, scripted sort of way you might get in a nice chain restaurant.)I eventually found out that this is a firmware problem has existed for some time with Harmony touch-screen remotes. The upper-level Logitech Harmony engineers are well aware of the firmware bug that causes this problem - though the front line support personnel seem ignorant of the problem. See the following link on the Harmony support site which discusses the problem: http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Harmony-Hub-Based-Remotes/My-Harmony-Ultimate-is-very-slow-to-respond-when-i-tap-the/td-p/1243238 (Harmony was very reluctant to admit this problem existed so don't be surprised if the above link is taken down.)Just to be clear: this was NOT just a case of having gotten one defective unit. The freezing/delayed response problem was exhibited in all four of the remotes that I purchased. This is a universal firmware problem affecting this entire line of touch-screen remotes - and one which has been acknowledged to me by upper level Harmony engineers.The upper level support engineers had me submit my logs once again and told me that a firmware update was being worked on to fix the problem. They initially told me that the firmware update would be available in a couple of days. Then that estimate was extended to within a week. Two weeks later, not having received notice of the update, they finally conceded that they no longer had an estimated date for the firmware fix and they would be in contact with me when it was available.During this saga I called in to the Harmony support line countless times. The support line is answered with a recorded greeting from the head of Harmony customer experience who offers his personal email address at the end of the greeting and invites callers to email him directly if their concerns are not satisfied. I started to copy this person on my email exchanges with support engineers. Then I wrote two emails directly to him outlining my frustrations, providing incident numbers, and seeking his assistance. The response was . . . crickets. It's been almost three weeks since I first reached out to this person and still I have received no response from him. So I must conclude that the invitation to contact him directly is simply marketing B.S. Who knows, maybe he is not even a real person.Of course, I returned all four remotes before the Amazon 30 day return window expired.Seeking another alternative I found that the reviews online for the Harmony 650 remote were generally very positive. Call me a glutton for punishment after all the problems I had with the touch screen Harmony remotes - but last week I purchased two of the (much cheaper) Harmony 650 remotes to try out in my bedroom.So far (knock on wood) the Harmony 650s seem to be working out very well. They are older tech and do not have all of the bells and whistles of the touch screen remotes. But so far at least they seem actually to work! I find that I prefer them ergonomically since they have hard number buttons which are much more convenient than the touch screen remotes which you have to swipe to unlock, then swipe a second time to access the soft number buttons.If you have any components inside a cabinet you will need to utilize an IR extender kit in order to use the Harmony 650. There are several highly rated IR extender kits available on Amazon for a modest price. And the Harmony 650 won't control your Nest thermostat or Phillips Hue lights - if you have them. But you can already control these devices from your smart phone - so this is not much of a sacrifice.Because of the good experience I have had this past few days with the Harmony 650s in my bedroom, I just ordered two more Harmony 650s to replace the Ultimate Home remotes I had tried unsuccessfully to use in my family room and home gym. My family room is a closed cabinet system so I also ordered an IR Extender kit for that location.Keep in mind that I have only had the Harmony 650s for less than a week. It is possible that problems might crop up. But if I end up having problems with the Harmony 650s I pledge to update this review with that information.I seldom write reviews and have certainly never written such an extensive one. But after all of the wasted hours and frustration these remotes caused me I felt somewhat of a civic duty to warn others of the serious problems they are likely to experience with these remotes.Update to prior review as of 1/21/2015: I have received support on this issue. There is a firmware update that Logitech has given me for the Ultimate One (4.2.48), which has for the most part fixed the delayed response/freeze-up problems that I was having previously. As of the date of this update, this firmware has not yet been released for the Ultimate One, but should be available for the Ultimate Home remote. However, if you have these problems with the Ultimate One I suspect that you can get this update from tech support. It should be widely available soon. With this fix I can recommend the remote.\", 'JJ')]\n",

When I tried to replace it, I noticed that the stock battery was so inflated that it would not come out. I talked to Logitech tech support, and Logitech being the incredible company that it is, sent me a replacement. The problem is they no longer produce the 900, so I got this thing. I have used it for about a year. It is a fine remote if you have never used the 900, or never use the tracking buttons located at the top of the remote. If you do, as I do, and as many reviewers do, you will be annoyed with it. Proponents of this remote will tell you that you can program any button you want on the touchscreen, but not everything benefits from a touch screen interface. Remote buttons are one of those things. Especially when you don't want to take your eyes off your TV. Have you ever tried to control your A/V equipment using the IR blaster on your phone Its a similar experience.Pros:Nice ergonomic back, allows for dual handhold positions, which are required to access tracking buttons at topIR blaster works niceNew software allows easier programming- It was pretty easy before however.The charging base is ok, I prefer the 900 charging base where the remote lies flat.The battery isn't about to explode.Cons:Using it as a remote.There are touchscreen buttons to go back on the screen without a hard button return. Most users, thanks to Apple, are accustomed to a permanent go back hard button. This doesn't exist.In the end:I couldn't use it anymore.

            "[(\"Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea. I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two-year-old One with the failing buttons. Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways, Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points.Software: Try finding Roku for the Harmony. There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku. It's listed under DVD. Go figure. Try Apple TV. Good luck with that one. Brand new hardware (Ultimate One) with the same old crappy software. If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge, maybe they'd come up with a better system, but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago.Hardware: Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand, taking up much less room on the table where it sits. Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip. They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One, but also removed some pretty useful ones. These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen. Sometimes this works out well, and sometimes not. Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do. For me, I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don't want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony. Yes, troubleshoot. Not everything works right the first time.Some inconveniences: Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things Well, be careful with the Ultimate. About 1/4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other, and we're being careful. Also, for some reason they put the playback buttons (play, FF, REW, etc) above the touchscreen. Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen!Set up: Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine-tuned to my system (which took months to finesse!!!), set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate. Easy-cheesy. I don't look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same: lame. For now, the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part.If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution. For me it wasn't. If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don't mind the limitations, then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection. We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment. The old One is still on the charger for my wife's use (she doesn't care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate). The Ultimate is for me, most of the time. The individual equipment remotes are stashed close-by in case I need to access something I can't find on the Ultimate.If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century (they still have Laserdisc but don't have a proper category for ROKU) and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together, I'd love the Ultimate One. If they don't make changes to the software I won't buy a new One when this One wears out.\", 'JJ')]\n",

            "[(\"I have been using Logitech items for quite a while from mice to previous remotes. I was offered the chance to review this item and my impressions are favorable.1. What's in the box You receive the remote, plus the charging cradle and a brief instruction booklet.2. Aesthetic: I have the previous Harmony One remote and in comparison this unit is smaller. It is simply much more compact. The first obvious difference is the lack of a numerical keyboard. Second, this unit is designed to sit vertically in the charger (as opposed to horizontally with the previous model). Also, the off button, and many of the buttons are quite a bit smaller. The bottom side has a nice, rough material that seems resistant to slipping.3. Use: First off, I charged the remote for a while (a couple of hours) before doing anything. Once I got the unit turned on, I was directed to add information. I must confess that because I had a previous Harmony, the process of adding information was simple. However, one positive aspect is the account for adding information (and that is adding the components of your system and needs by each activity (TV, DVD, videogame console, etc) has been moved off from a computer based server, to a cloud based server. I did need to upgrade my account to the cloud by registering, but the cloud seemed to understand my need to upgrade and simply asked for a connection through the included USB cord and transferred the information. Advantage While I have my laptop, if for some reason my laptop takes a dive, I can use another computer to upgrade my remote easily.Actual use: Once I got everything squared away, I turned on the TV with the remote and began to figure this system out. This is quite a change from the previous remote. The touchscreen in the middle is a important part of the system. There are two buttons at the top ( a star (for favorite channels (easy to set up based on TV provider and channels available) and a Home button for activities). Once the thing is on you can switch between favorite channels, activities, a number pad, and a command page by swiping around. Also, there is a swipe on the bottom for bringing up the gestures page which enables the user to pause, play and change volume (amongst other functions).Nicely, there are buttons on the remote that make the touch-screen duplicative.In many ways, this system is a huge improvement over the previous version. I was originally not able to understand the system, but after a bit of use, the ways of this remote become pretty intuitive. I love how you can easily go to things like a help function (more on that in a bit), a devices button and ways to adjust the remote on the fly without having to access the cloud to update the remote.What things didn't I like (There are only a few things that are irritating on this remote based on my use. First off, I really wish that the remote didn't have the IR outlet on the bottom as opposed to the top like the previous remote. As this seems to be line of sight, which sometimes means that I have to hold the remote upwards rather than simply pointing (for some this is probably okay, but for me this seems dorky)). UPDATE: Once I posted this review, someone thoughtfully pointed out that my supposed complaint about the IR sensor being on the bottom was incorrect and actually that button is for the remote learning function. In fact, I simply had to point the remote at the system as always. Guess what Using the remote with the remote pointed at the system worked extremely well. Gone were the second presses and the irritations that the remote would miss some function. It works and I haven't had a problem since. So this is NOT a problem at all.Another irritation is that I think this remote makes it harder to have a older person or less techy person at the home as the help button is buried in the sub-menu instead of being readily available for those not familiar with the system. Though this is not something that occurs often, it is something I think about and I think this was a bad mistake (if you have older parents coming over this will be an issues).Overall: In many ways this is a great remote. I have really come to appreciate the touch-screen and the levels of menus accessible with this remote. Although there are some irritations, I still think this is a very nice remote and well worth the purchase to make things more simplistic with the home theater (who needs 5 remotes). With that in mind, I really really like this item, but I don't love it yet based on the quibbles above. This doesn't mean that are better solutions around, because I haven't seen them.++++Update: After some extensive use and modification, I am really starting to LOVE this item. The ability to make some slight changes without having to hook this up to the computer is terrific (such as modifying icon placements, start positions and similar things, this makes life easier) as well as the overall use, which as I become more used to the functions, becomes far easier. This is a great update and I am hiving some fun with even being able to modify individual icons on the channels. Awesome! The software package makes this incredibly easy to do, unlike the previous iteration which was far tougher.\", 'NN')]\n",

After all those hours I'm still completely dissatisfied.For starters, I had a very annoying problem with the initial setup. I could set up all of the devices and the activities, but then it would take forever to sync. It would hang at about 20-30 and never get past that point. I searched through many Logitech forums and found some suggestions that seemed to kind of help, but never quite got to 100. I even tried a different PC, which was strange because instead of using the same web-based installer it made me install the MyHarmony app on my other PC (same versions of Windows 7...no idea why it wouldn't use the same installer). Sitting at that different PC I finally got the idea to swap out a different USB cable. It turned out that the cheap stock USB cable had a bad micro USB connector. My AmazonBasics USB cable worked though.After that I was able to sync reliably every time. Then I had to make quite a few more changes and sync and re-sync.Now that it's completely set up, there's still one annoyance I can't resolve. Every time I launch the Watch TV activity (the main activity that I want to use this remote for) it changes the input on my TV. Then I have to manually change the input on the TV back to the right HDMI input. If this is an intelligent remote, it should know that the last activity was Watch TV and that there's no reason to change the input. I have no clue why it tries to change the input every time, and every time it picks the wrong one.If I switch from Watch TV to Watch Movie, it will operate my DVD player correctly, but again it picks some random (and wrong!) input on the TV. It's very frustrating.Aside from these frustrations, I don't like the form factor or the layout on this Harmony remote as much as I liked my previous Harmony remotes. The LCD screen gets very dirty. It defaults to a weird home page that I don't like.I'm very frustrated. It feels like their Harmony product line has gone the wrong direction over the years.

            "[('Logitech Harmony Ultimate One IR Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control (915-000224)Logitech finally came up with a replacement for the supremely popular Harmony One remote. It is called the Ultimate One and it is essentially the Ultimate without the RF kit. It is exactly that because in the software there is an upgrade offer to sell you the RF puck and cables to transform this to the Ultimate. It adds the missing features like controlling devices in a cabinet and setting up smart devices, like an iPhone, to act as remotes. Its a good way to start out slow and add features if you need them. The upgrade is one hundred dollars, the same difference between the Ultimate and Ultimate One so its a reasonable way to expand it.The hand feel of the remote is good. It isnt too heavy and its smaller than the remotes that preceded it. The touch screen is larger than earlier models and there are fewer hard keys than before too. I do miss some easy to use keys over the touch screen but Im getting used to the overall use. The screen visual quality is good but because of the layout Favorite icons are smaller than before and they suffer in terms of resolution. Overall the screen is easy to see and the hard buttons are all backlit for easy seeing in the dark. The lights all go dim by a user settable timer. The afore mentioned icons can be used to set up 50 favorite channels for ONE provider. This is the biggest shortcoming for the current line-up of Harmony remotes. Previously you were able to set up multiple carriers, such as Time Warner Cable and Over The Air and have sets of icons for each one. That ended with the new software and new remotes. Tech support says they are considering a change but as of this writing, its as it is. There have been numerous updates and feature enhancements for the Ultimate remote and the U1 takes advantage of them. Among the updates was the addition of a sleep timer in the remote so you can shut off the activity you are watching while falling asleep. They also added the ability to add custom backgrounds, in addition to the included set. A good source for custom icons and soon, backgrounds is iconharmony dot com. Using these custom graphics really helps to personalize your remote.My one main nit to pick with the hardware is the choice to seal in the battery. On previous remotes Logitech had issues with the battery pack expanding and they wound up replacing many remotes. I dont think the solution to use a custom sealed in battery is a good choice. When the battery dies you will have to mail in the remote to them or a service center. Not a great solution in my opinion.You program the remote with a website app at myharmony dot com. On the forum they recently announced a new software offline solution is being rolled out. This was how it used to be and many are happy it is coming back. This is a very good but not perfect and certainly not an Ultimate remote. I do like it and have grown used to it, including using its brother The Ultimate, and I do like it. If I was designing it Id have used a much higher resolution screen and used standard rechargeable, replaceable batteries. So Im deducting one star but still recommend it for its usability with the vast amount of systems.', 'JJ')]\n",

I just wanted to quickly share my experience with this remote. I'm using the remote only, with no harmony hub. First off, this remote is about as sexy as remotes can get. It feels great in the hand, and is very ergonomic, all of the buttons are easily accessible with one hand. The battery came with enough juice for me to setup and tinker right out of the box. Setup is a breeze add devices, add activities, add favorites, done in 10 minutes max. I initially had trouble with the activities. The remote was not giving my TV long enough to turn on, so it wasn't switching to the proper input. I though I was going to have to go in and tinker with the delay settings, but the remote asked me if everything went smoothly, and when I told it no, it asked me a few simple questions to determine what went wrong, and get me watching immediately. After that, I had no more issues. Based on my answers to the questions it asked me, it automatically adjusted the delays between commands, no need to hook it back up to my computer. On some of the older harmony remotes that I've used, you had to turn all of your devices off in order to start a new activity. With this remote, the TV can stay on. When I am in a watch blu ray activity, and I press watch xbox, it turns off my blu ray player, turns on my xbox, and switches the inputs on my TV, fantastic!! I can't begin to express how pleased I am with this remote. It replaced 6 big clunky remotes, and works like a charm. That being said, there are 3 features I would like to see added, and they are all things that can be added with a firmware update on Logitech's end. When switching activities, I want it to ask me if I want to power off my current device, instead of just doing it automatically. I would also like the option to have the remote display a clock when docked, that way it serves a purpose when its just sitting there on your end table. It could also serve as a digital picture frame. It could easily store a couple dozen photos, and cycle through them while docked. If those feature were added, then remote controls can be improved upon no further. If you can spare 1/4 G, buy it right now.\", 'NN')]\n",

            "[(\"OK, I stole the review title from the infamous Highlander movie, but I did so because it does apply. The Harmony One, in world of universal remotes, really is the one remote that can replace all of your device remotes, but does so at a seemingly steep price, and with a small investment of time unless you are upgrading from another Logitech remote and your devices are already input into your online Logitech profile.This is my third Logitech remote - I am upgrading from an older model, the 650. The programming software I was using to update my 650 is no longer used by Logitech, nor does it even recognize the Ultimate One. So, despite logging in and repeatedly clicking upgrade remote, the remote could not connect to the Logitech website. I wasted two nights and about two hours trying to solve this problem and finally learned via Google that the One is not compatible with the old software. It would have been nice if this had been noted somewhere on the instructions.I was less than thrilled when I learned I would need to create a new profile and user name rather than simply logging in at the Logitech website with my existing information. Once I did, thankfully it asked if I had an existing account and once I entered my old information, it allowed me to port over all my existing devices. So, I got to where I needed to be but it took longer than it should have.Those of you who have Logitech remotes know that you enter your devices (TV model, DVD player, Home Theater Receiver model, etc) and then the software allows you to set up activities like watching a movie, playing a game. etc., and the software prompts you with questions about which device controls what function. (e.g., which device controls sound and volume, etc.) Once this is all programmed, you update the remote (which is connected to your computer) and off you go. Once this data is entered and configured, the One really shines. It lights up when you pick it up. You can control all your devices of course with just the one remote. You can even stagger power on or off order if you want. It will set your TV and other devices to the correct inputs if they need to be changed between functions.I use an Xbox One to watch my Blu Rays and DVD's. The Xbox controller is a poor TV remote. We like subtitles on when we watch DVD's. I was able to set up a quick one button macro in the Logitech software that walks through the four button presses required on the Xbox One to enable subtitles with a single button press on the Ultimate One. The software allows a high degree of customization that I really appreciate.Of course, this programming ability is part of what drives the high cost of the product. This isn't just a remote. It is really a software driven input device with a touch screen. (I use a combination of the touch screen and my buttons depending on my mood). It lights up when you pick it up, feels good in your hands, and in a feature I really like - it has its own charging cradle. Past versions really ate up batteries. I like returning it to its charging cradle after use because I know where it is when I need it again, and it saves me the cost of replacing batteries.As others have noted, not everyone would consider spending 250 on a remote. Even if you are willing to spend the money, you still need some basic technological prowess to program and fine tune this remote to make it work for you. If you have relatives that still struggle with basic computer tasks or how to program their DVR to record their favorite shows, this is not a product for them. I have family members who could not ever hope to program this remote. It is not a complex task to do so, but for people who struggle with technology, programming this remote could be a formidable task.I have a fairly simple home theater line-up with no line of sight issues, so I can't address using this with a hub.

I acquired this through my company's award's program, otherwise I would have purchased it through Amazon. That said, it IS an expensive remote, but ... I think it is worth the price.This is my second Harmony, my first being the Harmony 700. I have been very happy with the 700, but it was getting a little long in the tooth, and I think some problems were developing. So, despite some of the negatives in reviews here, I decided to give the Ultimate One a try.First, I would like to address the ergonomics issue, specifically with regard to position of the controls for DVD/DVR/BluRay playback. I agree that for some this is a significant negative, but I think that ignores one major factor: the Harmony Ultimate One is primarily a TOUCH SCREEN DEVICE. These controls are available on the touch screen. To access the movement controls, you simply touch an up arrow button at the bottom of the screen. There, I've saved a bunch of people some heartache ... you're welcome!Further to the touch screen, there are multiple screen pages available. As with smart phones and other touch screen mobile devices, you simply swipe through the screens. Even with the default settings, you can control most, if not all device and activity functions. Naturally, after a limited time using the remote, I will probably discover some things I want to tweak or add. But that's true with any new device.One feature that was not available on my 700 (which I plan to wipe and reprogram for a setup in a different room) is the ability to download favourite channels based on your location (zip code or postal code) and provider. Whoa, that is cool -- it saves a lot of time.The next new feature not available on my 700 is that this is primarily a WiFi based remote. I wasn't sure how this would work, and whether the hub/blaster architecture would work properly for my physical entertainment centre. However, connecting to my WiFi network was flawless and the signalling to devices has worked perfectly as far as I can tell at this point.And in regard to signalling, the Ultimate One is MUCH faster than my 700. Maybe when I reprogram the 700 I can speed it up, but at this point I think the Ultimate is just plain better.The setup of the Ultimate One was quick and painless. The web-based installation gave me the option of transferring the settings from the 700 to the Ultimate, and it worked perfectly. Even without this advantage, first-time owners of a Harmony remote will find program so much easier than most other universal remotes.After getting the Ultimate set up, I downloaded the Harmony Control app for my iPond Touch, and my wife will download the app for her iPhone and iPad. My brief experience with the app is that it is cleanly designed and performs well.So my summary for initial impressions is that this is a great remote. I frankly think that a lot of negative points in reviews are overblown. I am not judging the reviewers, but think that the overall perspective of having a solidly designed, well manufactured remote that offers the performance that it does, well, my opinion is many if not of the most of the niggles are minor.

Harmony line is getting better overall, better web interface, instructions, etc.I do not want to repeat many of the items listed in previous reviews which I agree with...however, I will add this...before jumping in, ask yourself, what am I really gaining here If you have a lot of complex remotes, sometimes it can take u days, maybe weeks to get this Harmony to do everything the current remote does.

But I've had quibbles with all of them over time, and I'll go over some of those quibbles - and why they've been eliminated from the nearly perfect Harmony Ultimate One.The first quibble was size and feel. It was difficult to reach buttons on larger versions of the harmony without swinging it two-handed like a broadsword. This version is easy to manipulate, from top to bottom.The second was the touchscreen. With old Harmony remotes the odds you could get through a TV session without accidentally brushing the touchscreen and landing, inevitably, on channel 1 were next to nil. This one does an excellent job of disregarding inadvertent contact with the screen. In addition, the screen is much more useful, with swipe motions to go between the four major functions (touchpad, number pad, function screen and channel screen).The third was the setup. This is the main selling point for the Harmony, the ability to make all your devices function with one touch for an activity. Previously, this required a lot of manual finesse. One example: my receiver needs about 5 seconds after turning on to boot and receive additional commands. With the old remotes, I had to manually program in the delay. With the Ultimate One, the delay is accounted for. I can't imagine how much product testing and research by the logitech team went into the presets that accompany each device you add, but I haven't had to customize the remote's interaction with *anything.* It just works.\", 'NN')]\n",

            "[(\"Harmony Ultimate One ReviewA few weeks ago I received and then responded to an E-Mail/survey from Logitech (It pays to register your products!). To make a long story short although I am not a professional reviewer, they chose to give me a Harmony Ultimate One universal remote to test and review as a customer (how cool is that). Anyway, regardless of how I got my hands on this unit, I promise an honest review, so here it goes:Ease of SetupWhen I received the Ultimate One (I'll refer to it as the U1 for the remainder of the review), I had already been familiar with the My Harmony website, where I had set up the U1's predecessor the Harmony Touch. Just like that endeavor, setting up the U1 on the website was as simple as can get. You're walked through each step beginning with finding your components on their HUGE database (I had no trouble finding all my gear), then arranging your activities (e.g. watch TV, listen to a CD, play a video game, etc.) and finally synching everything together to make it work. The bigger and more complex your system, the longer it may take you to set up the remote, but the ease of it all remains the same. Using the website to set up the remote is a trouble free and actually pleasurable experience. SCORE: 5 out of 5Ability to CustomizeThe U1 allows for some pretty cool customization. For one example, you can upload jpeg photos for icons. So, in theory, if you took a digital photo of yourself, you can use that picture as an icon to watch TV (the inner geek in me loves this stuff)! Aside from that, you can change background colors, change the name of an activity (like changing watch TV to Living Room TV), adjust the touch screen brightness, etc. One cool feature is that you can adjust the brightness of the back-lit hard buttons independent from the touch screen (nice). You can even choose how you want the unit to provide tactile vibration feedback when you press a touch screen button/icon (also a nice touch). On the down side, if you're into animated menus and icons, you won't find any here. SCORE 4.5 out of 5Performance/Ease of UseThe simplicity of the U1's setup transferred to its use. Logitech seems to get everything right off the bat. After listing my gear and arranging my activities, everything works perfectly. I don't know how they do it, but the delay times, sequence of power on/input choice, etc... was perfect. If for some reason it isn't, you can always adjust as needed. For TV viewing, Logitech Harmony provides 50 favorite channels, which show up as Icons on your U1. So, if you program HBO HD into your favorites, simply press the appropriate Icon to get that channel. The best part is, the Icon's, along with the corresponding channel numbers, are selectable from Logitech's impressive database (simple as can get). Being that this is an IR remote (with good line of sight coverage), if you accidentally move away while turning your components on, or off, causing a part of your system not to respond to IR commands, simply activate the help feature. The U1 will guide you through all of your components, ensuring that each one is on and the appropriate inputs are engaged in your display device/receiver/switcher. SCORE 5 out of 5ErgonomicsMuch has been written about the transport buttons located on top of the U1's predecessor, the Touch. They are still there on the U1, however, the fast forward and rewind buttons perform double duty: keep your finger pressed on either and you can skip/go back to the next/previous Blue Ray, DVD or CD chapter or track (I Like!). The vibrate feature (when you hit a touch screen Icon) and the auto-on based on motion, are HUGE improvements over the Touch, in my opinion. I don't know if Logitech meant for it to be handled this way, but concerning the aforementioned transport buttons on top of the remote... I find that it's easier to manipulate them with my forefinger than thumb. The backside of the remote has a more tactile friendly feel (like very light sandpaper). The front touch screen, surrounded by the hard buttons nestled onto the remote, is quite attractive. The non-contact areas finished in piano-gloss black add to the fit and finish. SCORE 4 out of 5ValueIt's hard to assign a value rating on consumer electronics. In my opinion, one must decide: Does it make my life easier Does it make my life more enjoyable If the answer to both of those questions is yes, then what's an appropriate price for such bliss At 249.99, the U1 isn't cheap however, for a home theater nut like me...its value is awesome! Would I recommend this remote for someone with just a flat panel and cable box Absolutely not! There are far less expensive options out there for that. Now, if money is absolutely no object and you asked me...I would say yes! However, I would also wonder why you don't have a more advanced, complex system. For the Home Theater enthusiast (like me...), the U1 is a very good value. After spending literally thousands (over the years) on Home Theater equipment, 249.99 is indeed a good value. SCORE 4.5 out of 5Plus and minusesPlus: Incredibly easy set up and use. Gesture capability with customization. Can control 15 devices. Comes with charger and one year warranty! Vibrate command option. Motion control backlight. Fifty channel favorites with appropriate Icons.Minus: The infamous transport buttons located above the touch screen. Price for simple systems may not be a value. You cannot replace the rechargeable battery.Final ThoughtsGet this remote! If you have components hidden away in cabinets or out of the direct line of sight for infrared, then purchase the Harmony Hub (about 100.00). I use it in my home theater and it works beautifully. However, as a standalone remote, the U1 has pretty good range for IR (as did its predecessor, the Touch). If you have more than a flat panel and a cable box, this remote should be at the top of your list. You will be able to set it up quickly and be able to use it efficiently.

            "[(\"I bought this remote to replace an old Harmony One, and so far it has been a good replacement. It does NOT operate devices out of line of sight (there has been some confusion in earlier reviews regarding this, even though there's nothing in the description that says that it does), which is fine for me all of my devices are behind glass and this works just fine. If you need beyond-line-of-sight functionality you'll have to spring for the more expensive version with the hub.Setup was easier than my old remote, the web-based setup had a better knowledge of the actual names of the inputs and outputs on my receiver, so there was no trial and error as could happen with the older model. All told, setup took about 10 minutes most of this was waiting for a firmware update. Actual defining of activities, devices, and inputs took only a few minutes and worked the first time.All that said, the ergonomics of this remote are not as good as the old Harmony One. The lack of a hardware number pad is unfortunate but a reasonable tradeoff for the reduced size, but the real problem is the placement of the DVR controls on the top. It's annoying and forces you to move your hands too much for these commonly-used controls. Besides this, it's a nice remote and I plan to use it for a long time.\", 'NN')]\n",

It was a four step process (add components, add activities, add your favorite channels, and one more I'm forgetting). Setting up my favorite channels took me the longest, but I'm super organized, so I was moving channels around and going through all of my channels.The customization possibilities with this remote seems endless. When there were buttons that were either missing or didn't do what I wanted, it was super easy to either add a whole new button/functionality (by simply pointing my old remote at my Harmony and teaching my Harmony the new button) or edit a current button.You can edit graphics as well, such as the background or your favorite channel icons. I also created a Sequence (basically a macro), which worked perfectly fine - my sequence was watch in 3D which, while in my Watch a Movie activity, had about 4 steps of using my TV's 3D function. I even added a delay of 3 seconds before a couple actions (such as waiting for a screen to fully display before the Exit action was selected).Customizing this remote does require SOME technical skills, but that's expected with this remote, I think. It is pricey, but for what it does and how it's already programmed for each of my components, I think I got my money's worth.If I had to nitpick, it's not as easy as it should be to connect the sync cable to the remote. And also, it'd be much nicer if it was bluetooth instead of having to connect a cable to sync.I replaced 5 remotes and it works great for all:Sharp TV: LC-80LE844UYamaha receiver: RX-V473Sony Blu-ray player: BDP-BX57DVR receiver: Motorola VIP1216Xbox 360And I'll soon be adding Xbox OneI have a Wii U, but this remote won't work with that, which is fine, because I use Xbox for media streaming.Overall, I highly recommend this remote for anyone with the same needs as me!\", 'NN')]\n",

            "[('I have owned Harmony remotes since long before Logitech bought out the company.I have lived with the knowledge that each remote would only last about 3 years before some form of button failure would develop, but it was worth it because no other remote on the market had the ergonomics and feature base and ease of setup of a Harmony remote.My fifth and best remote was a 900 and it was a fantastic remote until the volume and channel buttons started to fail at the young age of only 2 1/2 years.So I went out and bought a Harony Ultimate One at Best Buy and man oh man did I regret that! First of all has Harmony completely forgotten why remotes like the 1000 where failures and remotes like the 900 and the orginal Harmony One where great success stories Yes Harmony it was the BUTTONS and the right mixture of LCD that made the remote a must have. With the Ultimate you have too much LCD and not enough hard buttons. With LCD buttons you have to constantly look down at the remote when trying to do anything! With Physical buttons you can feel your way around the remote. Anyone who uses a remote for 2-3 weeks will become very use to finding most of the needed buttons without ever looking down once at the remote. With Touch screen buttons you can use it for years and you will still need to look down to see if your finger is over the right spot.Now while I am not happy towards the lessening of physical buttons and the leaning towards touch screen, I knew what I was getting into so I was willing to live with that until hopefully Harmony realized the mistake and made a more button packed remote like the 880, 900. But then acame the problems, it was like the remote had a built in Gremlin that just messed with it every so often. I dealt with lockups galore, problems with the LCD light staying on and killing the batteries and then prgogramming issues that I never had with any harmony remote before. In the end I packed up this puppy and sent her back.The real shame of all of this is that Harmony put the words Ultimate on this remote when in fact they have had so many better models over the years. Lesson for Harmony is go back to basics and give the customers what they want, not what is cheapest to build. This remote finaly crossed the line and got into the realm of low quality with too much glitz and sparkle and not enough of what once made Harmony remotes great.', 'NN')]\n",

Even if the device is not in the database, you can still learn commands from the original remote as a last resort.I like the harmony remotes because of the Activity concept. One button can, for example, turn on the TV, receiver and Blu-Ray player and set all the inputs to the correct setting ready to watch, while turning off unused devices. The more gadgets you have, the more benefit you get from a device like this.This was an upgrade/replacement for an old model Harmony 525, and while I like this well enough, it is more complicated in use than the old model.General build quality is very good, much better than the older model, it feels sold and weighty in the hand. The rounded back makes it easy and comfortable to hold, but it wobbles around on the coffe table. The remote slides easily into the charging dock, and as the 525 used to chew through batteries, this is much better. However, the battery in the remote is not easily replaceable, so I hope it has reasonable longevity.The feel of the backlit hard buttons is very good, with a nice positive click, much better than the old dead flesh rubber buttons on the 525.The D-pad and navigation buttons are well placed and easy to use, but the main play/pause/FF/RW controls are a bit awkwardly placed, but still useable.The touch screen display provide customisable soft buttons and obviously conveys much more information than the tiny monochrome LCD on the old model, but as it is a capacitive type, like a smartphone, it is very sensitive and easy to hit the wrong soft-key. The remote beeps and vibrates when a touch screen button is used, but it's not as positive as a real button and you have to look at the remote - you can't navigate by feel.Fortunately the touch screen is used mostly for secondary functions, and the hard keys cover the typical primary controls. Number keys are only touch-screen buttons and therefore more difficult to use than real buttons, but favourite Sky channels can be shown as a colourful page of icons, which is easier than remembering the channel number. However, to be honest, if you are like me you use the Sky Guide page anyway, which only needs the direction pad to navigate. To be fair after a few weeks, I really have put away all the original remotes as I don't need them, so this device does the job.The programming software is pretty easy to use, a bit quirky in some ways, but since I was used to the old version, I found it easy enough, and the new version is an improvement. Also, unlike the old 525 model, a certain amount of customisation can be done directly on the remote without using a PC at all. You can do a basic set up in a few minutes, but you will probably need a couple of hours to set it up perfectly of you have several devices to control.\", 'NN')]\n",

All with the exception of the Elite model, it's very tempting but the price is not premium I want to fork over if it ends up like the Ultimate One model. this is a nice remote and a bit of a conundrum in itself with other issues. The layout and ergonomics are not pleasing to hold and use, although I can use the top video controls (play, pause, rewind, FF, etc.) I rest my middle finger and index finger between the little fin on the bottom, still a klutzy feel. I've been using this for about two week, I'm working with it. I had to setup the swipe lock for the screen because my palm wrecks my entire viewing experience with just a light brush of skin to screen contact. The ability to fully customize the pages would be nice, other than changing a background picture adding and deleting favorite channel icons.The make it or break it part, when I return it will be because of the activities I set up. It's getting old when you switch between activities and one or more component either responds when it shouldn't or doesn't respond at all. My programming is right, I have or currently use at least three of the lower tier remotes. It's frustrating for over 200 dollars, a 40-50 dollar pricetag wouldn't burn me so much. This Ultimate One remote has problems pretty much all the time. Once, a message popped up and told me a sync error, it was hung up for thirty minutes. The message told me to unplug/plug the remote and restart sync, it took maybe two minutes after that. I do it now each time it gets hung up for more than ten minutes I unplug it and restart the sync, two minutes and I'm fixed for that moment. I'll use my 350's, 650 and 700 remotes because it's beginning to look like those are my only reliable options.This is a nice remote, but everything I mentioned above will cut its lifespan short in my home.

If I could, I'd rate 3.5 stars, but I rounded up.The good: Can handle more devices/activities than the 650. The touch screen is clean and responsive, but not overly sensitive so you don't have to worry about accidently launching a command while swiping. Scrolling up/down or side/side is a breeze. It has the most commonly used hard buttons available, so you can perform many functions without needing to look at the remote. Has an internal battery and comes with a charging stand.The bad: It doesn't have a very fluid design at all, nor is it easy to grip if you're trying to use the dvr/dvd controls at the top of the remote. Not sure why they went away from a more traditional remote design, but this was really bad decision making by Logitech.The remote is also kind of slow during the power on phase of various activities. Ex: I use the Watch TV activity to power on my tv/satellite receiver/theater and the remote stays in the starting mode for a good 15-20 seconds, so you can't immediately change to the channel you want or adjust volume until the remote finishes it's cycle. And you need to keep the remote pointed at your devices until they all power on. First world problems for sure, but the 650 didn't do that.Activities don't work once they've been activated. Ex: Using the Watch TV activity to power on my devices, let's say the theater doesn't power up. With the 650, I could just hit the Watch TV button a 2nd time and it would power the theater on without powering off the tv and satellite receiver. Not the case here. You have to go to the Help screen and once it turns your receiver on, it turns everything else off. Very frustrating when this happens.Battery life isn't that great. I get about 3 days between charges. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I expected to be able to go at least a week. Good news is it only takes about 30 to fully charge.The touch screen has a swipe to unlock feature. I guess this is great if I'm worried about a stranger seeing what my favorite channels are, but it just seems kind of pointless.Most of the shortcomings for this remote are pretty minor, buy there's a lot of minor shortcomings which is what keeps me from giving a better rating. I don't hate the remote at all. Overall I'm happy with it, but it seems like Logitech tried to literally break the mold with this remote and came up short.

My biggest complaint with both models was that after a couple short years (or less), they just did not seem to work as well - either signals became weaker, or macros got corrupted, not sure...but especially considering the cost of the One, I was not impressed with the durability.Enter the Smart Control (not Ultimate) model, which I finally ponied up for after getting so frustrated with the One, where the range seemed to deteriorate over time, which is just amazingly frustrating. The Smart Control to me, represented the pinnacle of the line to date, until I was able to review the Ultimate, which resolves pretty much every complaint I have about the non Ultimate version.Make no mistake, both are great, but the Ultimate IMO, really is worth that extra cost due primarily to the following differences:1. Ultimate adds the touch screen of course, which solves the problem of having to use a phone to fix issues (automated help when the macros don't do what is expected), but of course also gives you access to all the detailed functions missing on the simple remote included with the non-Ultimate model.2. Charging station. I really liked this about the One, and I guess due to having a screen, it's more crucial to have this than with the non-Ultimate version, which does not include a station. It's also just a good place to keep the remote so I always know where it is.3. Backlit keys. Seemingly small thing, but for me personally, this is a HUGE deal, and one of the biggest reasons I prefer the Ultimate over the non-Ultimate.4. Haptic feedback and tilt sensor. Again, small things, but both add to the advantage of the Ultimate. They are nice to have' features that really helps the Ultimate get that extra nod over the non-Ultimate.And of course, the success of both of these remotes is the Smart Hub, IMO. Even if you aren't sitting far away, or have devices in wall, or behind cabinets, this hub I think is the real key to the success over the previous models like the One and its predecessors. So nice to not have to worry about PS3 integration, not to mention the success rate of the macros working properly has increased to probably 95 (I would say about 50 for the One)Overall, the Ultimate One represents years of development and tweaking, and IMO, has resulted in an excellent remote to top the line.Can't recommend enough, if you can get past the spendy price, but I really don't see any other alternatives in the market with this kind of functionality at this price point.\", 'JJ')]\n",

So when I use the canned activity Watch TV , the receiver ends up on the wrong input every time because the Harmony is trying to change it before the receiver is ready.

My understanding is that this remote is similar to the Harmony Touch, and Identical to the remote in the Harmony Ultimate package (with the IR Hub).The big possible deal breaker here is the lack of a physical number pad. I realize that can be a deal breaker for some people, but it's an obvious change and you know what you're getting in that regard.The device itself feels very well built. I like the ergonomics, but that's a matter of opinion of course. Aside from the physical number pad, you are short a couple of physical buttons that appear on some other models, but in exchange you have the wonderful feature of being able to assign a long and short press to each physical buttons (distinguished by a nice haptic feedback), allowing you to set a great deal of commands. The other great feature compared to my previous remote, is the ability to add and remove commands, and rearrange the screen on the device itself, without having to connect to a PC. You still need to sync to a PC to change the physical buttons, but it's still a welcome addition.The tilt sensor, which wakes the device when you pick it up, is also much more sensitive and functional than my old Harmony One, which almost required a shake. A small thing, but again nice.Some complain about the media controls (play, FF, RW, etc) being at the top of the remote. I don't find it that much of an issue. Plus, the touchscreen allows you to set EXTREMELY helpful gesture commands (which again can be setup from the device itself). The options for gestures are:TapDouble TapSwipe LeftSwipe RightSwipe UpSwipe DownSwipe Left and holdSwipe Right and holdSwipe Up and holdSwipe Down and holdSo by simply assigning swipe left and right as FF and RW, and tap as Play/Pause, you have a nice alternative if the button layout bothers you. But again, I find the physical key positions are easy to get used to.Lastly, there are the usual customization features, most of which are either implemented better, or at least more easily than previous models, such as custom screen wallpapers, customer activity icons (unavailable on the Harmony one), etc..All in all, while the ergonomics and on screen number pad may be a bit unusual at first, it's a fantastic remote. Go and pick up and hold one in person at a store if possible, so you know what it feels like. But function wise, it's exactly what you'd expect if you have experience with Harmony remotes in the past.Oh, one last thing, the Battery isn't replaceable. Never a great product decision in my mind, but I had my Harmony One for almost 5 years and it still held a charge for several days without issue, so i'm not overly concerned. The battery also doesn't last quite as long as my old Harmony one, possibly due to the larger screen.. but for me that means about 2 or 3 days, instead of 5 or 6, which is not really an issue.So in summary, I've previously loved each Harmony remote I've owned more than the last. This case is a little different though. My last Harmony was definitely an incredible remote and each of my previous remotes were definite improvements over each other. However, in this case I'd say this one is less of an objective improvement, and more of a change or alternative style in remotes. There are a few extra features for sure. But just looking at the physical remotes and their core functionality, I'd say that the Harmony Ultimate remotes and the old Harmony One are equal and it would come down to preference (mostly in regards to the feel of the buttons and the ergonomics.)\", 'NN')]\n",

Something changed over time, and now EVERY time we start an Activity, we need to go to the Fix it myself function because there is always one problem or another with one of the devices. Also, the response time of the devices is MUCH slower with the Harmony than when using the the remote that comes with the device. So, for example, when you press the Play/Pause button during a Fast Forward, it takes about 3 seconds to respond, which forces you to have to Rewind, which is then also delayed when you try to stop it. Usually, we just end up giving up. There is also a problem with the over-sensitive recognition of gestures, which causes things to happen when we don't want them to, and therefore must be undone. It has become a frustration to use the Harmony remote, and we frequently end up just using the remotes that came with the devices. Sort of defeats the purpose, don't you think Especially when you consider the cost of this product. We tried to re-sync the Harmony Remote to see if that would correct some of the issues we're having. At first the sync ran for hours without completing. The message on the remote said not to disconnect because it was in the middle of an update, but we finally disconnected/reconnected the remote, and the sync finally finished. But, much to our disappointment, all of the problems are still there. The only thing we can think of doing now is to delete all of our devices and activities and re-enter them. Since this is time-consuming, and should be unnecessary, it only adds to the frustration. This is not the kind of PR Logitech should want for its product.\", 'NN')]\n",

At first Logitech refused to replace, but I was persistent and it paid off.My review follows:I have only had this unit for a few days, but so far I like it. It's a completely different concept than their old remotes. The software is new, and you program for your area and you service provider. So far so good.My first issue was, my zip code. About 4 years ago, the USPS, in it's infinite wisdom changed my zip code. Four years later, Logitech hasn't yet caught up. When I entered my zip code, nothing. Then, on a whim, I entered my old zip code, one that doesn't exist anymore, and bingo, it was recognized.The programming from there was tedious but pretty easy. Te remote allows you to select up to 50 of your favorite channels, and you chose them from a touch screen using icons that identify the channel and also shows the channel number. You can also arrange these icons in any order you want. The icons are small, and some are hard to read. What this means to me is, that I no longer have to use DirectTVs Channel Guide to locate the channel number, and then enter that on a keypad on the remote. I simply scroll on the touch screen until I find the channel I want and tap. The remote has made a few mistakes, but generally it's pretty good and choosing the correct channel. It does save time. There is also the option of a numeric touch screen for those instances where you want to enter a numeric number. I don't think I will be using the numeric key pad much. Also, during the programming, there was an instance where Logitech's software hadn't picked up the complete channel lineup, but there is a provision that allowed me to manually enter it, albeit with a generic icon. So far it works for me.As a final thought, as I mentioned earlier, this was a replacement for a Harmony One that had a swelled battery and had become dangerious to use because of excessive heat coming from the remote. The battery in the Harmony One is in a nacelle and once it starts to swell, it's impossible to remove, I know I tried. I also have a Harmony 880, that battery had also started to swell, but the battery is mounted in a conventional way, and it was easily changed. I guess Logitech is worried about this going forward, because the battery in the Ultimate One is NOT, that's right, is NOT replaceable. The instructions say that when the unit reached end of life Who knows when that is You dismantle (destroy) the unit and remove the battery for disposal.I don't believe this is the proper solution on an electrical item that has a list price of 250.00.\", 'NN')]\n",

Finally the buttons to select an activity and its associated controls started becoming intermittent and it was time to find something else. I looked at the Harmony Ultimate hub and its associated controllers WiFi, but the limit of 2 IR repeaters vs. my multiple drawer layout just wouldn't work for me. I finally settled on the Ultimate One (the drawers have glass fronts).I downloaded the new MyHarmony app - I'd been using the older Java app for years, but decided to give this one a try - especially since it claimed to be able to transfer from my old heavily customized 880 - and it did! About 95 of all the customized buttons came over. I needed to re-assign the color keys at the bottom, but that was easy to do.The one glitch I had was in setting up Favorites - I failed to notice that the Favorites also automatically invokes one of your activities (which would typically be 'Watch TV'). Unfortunately, that's not the one it defaulted to. After setting up all of the Favorites, I was wondering why it kept starting 'Watch DVR' when I touched a favorite - RTFM! The unpleasant part came when I could find no way to go back and change that without removing all of the Favorites (a call to Tech Support at 6PM EDT came back with a recording that TS was closed - please call back between 9AM and 10 PM !). Anyhow, after re-doing the setup everything was fine - except the channel logos were blurry and relatively ugly.Enter www.iconharmony.com - a great site for almost every channel logo imaginable. I downloaded some 35+ logos from them (and sent the author a little contribution via PayPal for his efforts) and uploaded those icons via MyHarmony. They look a whole lot better - I don't know why Logitech/Harmony can't start with them out of the box.Similarly, the activity icons could use some help - a quick Google search turned up lots of icon sites I downloaded new icons and re-sized them to 70x70 using Photoshop, but there are a lot of apps that can resize images. You then upload them via MyHarmony.All in all, it took several hours worth of time at the computer - and that was with all of the activities and devices already defined from my 880. But at least part of that was my fault for not checking the Favorites Activity and then for wanting better-looking icons.The other thing I've noticed is that the Ultimate 1 seems to have a broader IR beam - I don't need to be quite as careful in aiming it as with the 880.As many others have commented, I also wish it had physical number buttons, but I've not found it that difficult to swipe the screen to get the number panel up. Similarly, the FF, Play/Pause buttons at the top haven't seemed to be such a nuisance as others have described - but I'm used to using 2 hands with the remote. I also found it easier to move (Menu-Edit) the Favorites icons around on-screen on the remote vs. on the app.Something that's a bit hidden away is the full device control - on the 880 you used the Devices button to bring up another screen which then gave you all of the learned device controls. On the Ultimate 1, you use the Menu-Devices to get you to a similar screen of devices, the to their detail controls.\", 'NN')]\n",

So I had a friend make a suggestion and he came up with this Logitech Harmony Ultimate One IR Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control (915-000224).First, let me say that even after using computers since their inception in the early 80's I wanted no part in even trying to set this up myself.I hired a guy who's in the wiring business of audio-video, telephones etc, and he set it up. He's a pro and eventually he did get it all working, but not before having to speak to tech support on more than one occasion. It seems there was a couple of known bugs but you never get that information on the first go round. Anyway, I can say that even the most challenged (technically) member of my family can use it. i.e. No more complaining. Now, I breeze through turning everything on and off with just one remote. I like the graphic interface and the ease of its use. I love the fact that you pick it up in a dark room and it lights up automatically so you can see the interface without having to push a button first. This is a really good product. In a sense it is a five star product, losing only one star for the set up issues.One other thing to add though, is that there are two parts to the system and, at first, I bought just the remote. I seemed to have missed the fact that you need both the IR Remote AND the Logitech 915-000238 Harmony Home Hub, so I had to buy the other part as well.

As an owner of the previous Harmony One (the remote without Ultimate in its name) I would have rated that model 5 stars. It sported several additional buttons to handle specific functions, and the buttons were larger, with different shapes and feel, and they were well laid out. The remote was a bit larger and heavier, but oh what a pleasure to use, whether with the built in backlighting or simply by feel. The Ultimate One by comparison has fewer buttons, thereby necessitating that some of them perform two completely different functions (a short press will perform a channel up or channel down function and a long press will move up or down one page of the on-screen channel guide. You'll be surprised and thoroughly annoyed by how many times you will perform one of those functions when you really meant to perform the other. In addition the buttons are tiny and pretty much the same size and shape, making it very easy to hit the wrong one. Case in point, the tiny mute button lives right below the Volume Down button. I'd like to have a dollar for every time my finger inadvertently hit mute when I was trying to reduce the volume of sound. I suppose the remote is called Ultimate because it is capable of responding to gestures similar to a computer tablet. The function is nice, but nowhere as efficient as a good set of buttons.The software used to set up the remote is not easy, especially for first time users. If you have previous experience with setting up and using home theater equipment as well as computers you should be able to navigate the software, though not easily. If you lack experience with that equipment you'd probably be better of having someone set up the remote for you. Having said all this, I would be remiss if I didn't say that this remote, despite its serious shortcomings is hands down better than the 3 or 4 remotes you would have to use to control a good home theater system.

I know it looks tempting, I know it looks slick, it's certainly nicely packaged, but it's a horrible product.The number one thing a remote maker has to get right in my opinion is the ergonomics, feel and balance of the unit. Those of us that watch a lot of TV (for better or worse!) have this thing in our hands a lot of the time, and it needs to feel right. The Ultimate One fails immediately in this regard. The weight and balance is just off, making it awkward to use the touch screen and gestures, and the top buttons (which are actually used a lot when watching shows on DVR) feel uncomfortable and out of reach. The unit feels constantly as though it is tipping forward or back. It's hard to describe, but it just doesn't sit right. I have large hands, and my wife's hands are pretty small, but we both became very frustrated with this remote after trying to use it for a few weeks. The fuzzy material on the bottom of the unit is a bad choice too. I'm not sure whether it's trying to have a leather like feel, but it feels like I'm holding a loofah.

I loved the One, it was reliable, easy to use, and felt nice in the hand. I have been using the Ultimate One for well a year now, and for the price this remote falls short.First was the set up. Logitech switched to a new program, so if you were coming over from a previous device you had to start from scratch. I feel that everything should have simply imported to the new program. This added a good amount of time to the set up. The remote itself looks great, and is lightweight. However, it does not feel as ergonomic as the One did. It is also lacking the number buttons, which makes quickly switching between several channels more time consuming than a traditional remote. You have to either scroll through the channels or go through the touch screen to find the channel icon you want.When it comes to functionality the remote really falls short. I purchased the 100 hub to control my PS3. The remote constantly loses its pairing with the system. I am them forced to get the PS3 controller and re-register the blu tooth device all over again. It defeats the entire purpose of the remote. It is also not uncommon for the remote and HUB itself to lose their pairing. Forcing you to either restart the HUB or connect the remote to a computer and reset it.The remote also has not had the ability to connect to a PS4 until recently, and it still can not turn the system on/off. If I still need to go to the system or use my PS remote, what is the use of the universal remote The remote also seems to incorrectly perform the start up or shut down of a process more frequently than my One did. Making me either press the help button, go into the devices and fix it myself, or physically get up and turn a component on of off.I would have given my One five stars to give you an idea of the step back this remote is. For the 350 I paid when it was new (including the HUB), this is a real let down.***Update 4/29/16***Somehow this remote has become even less functional. As noted above there is no easy way to change the channel with this remote. The icons are now completely useless. For example if I want to change to channel 44.1 I press the icon button because I do not want to scroll through 20 channels, and the on screen numbers do not work well. The first press will get me 4.1. Next 1, then 4.1, then .1, then 44. Finally I'm at a channel that I can just scroll to. Sometimes it never even gets close and I will just scroll through all the channels.

As compared to the 680, the buttons are far better: solid rather than spongy and, on the single-function buttons, a clear clicky feel (though silent) when acturated. I understand the complaints of users who prefer buttons over touch-screen controls or find it clumsy to operate with one hand, but neither is a concern for us. In fact, touch-screen control is very similar to a smartphone my somewhat technophobic wife found it easier to learn than the button-controlled 680.I'm using the unit without the hub, since we already have an IR integrator that controls all the devices from a single sensor under our wall-mounted TV. The IR output seems very strong and, unlike the standard Time Warner remote, doesn't have to be close to and aimed directly at the sensor.The device worked properly after the basic activity setup using the Windows software downloaded from the Logitech website. However, I soon discovered that it's even better after customization. Going beyond things like setting up favorite channels is not a job for the faint-hearted some computer expertise is needed. Also, the complete user manual should be downloaded from the Logitech website before attempting a more detailed customization.Unlike the 680, I found it unnecessary to add commands for the individual devices that were omitted from the basic setup. On the other hand, the ability to fine-tune the delay and switching times for each device was a big plus. With the 680, IR output continued for a much longer time than it took to activate the devices. This was a real nuisance. If, say the TV had been set at a high volume when it was turned off, and if a low volume was needed when turning it back on, I had to wait as much as 5 seconds with the TV blaring until I could access the volume control -- not good if someone was asleep in the next room.For me the need for a charging cradle is a plus. It sits on my nightstand next to the bed, is always handy and fully charged, and doesn't disappear into the bedding, onto the floor, into a nightstand drawer, or onto some other piece of bedroom furniture where I wouldn't think of looking for it.My only uncertainty about this remote is its longevity, which I can't comment on because it's still fairly new.

The most annoying problem is that often after making a change in the My Harmony app, the software very often throws an error telling me it cannot load the changes from the remote. Let me explain this - unlike older models, there are some limited changes you can make on the remote itself. In order for the software to keep these changes, it must first download them from the remote before up-loading the changes you have made in My Harmony so that they don't get lost.At this point, My Harmony just stops in its tracks and I cannot update changes. The ONLY way I have found to fix this is to perform a factory reset on the remote. This will get it to the point that I can now upload the new settings to the remote, but if I had made any changes on the remote itself, they would be lost. Fortunately for me, I don't make changes on the remote, so I get away with it. Logitech support have no solution for me other than to do what I'm doing - factory reset. This makes updating the remote a real chore that I don't look forward to.I also miss the physical buttons from the older Harmony remotes that are now only available on the touch screen (number keys, etc.) and the skip forward/back and fast forward/back keys that have been merged into one set of keys.Once programmed up, the remote actually performs as you would expect - starts up your components properly and controls everything correctly.

We are talking serious competitive advantage here folks.What the heck am I rambling about, you ask Its this: the ACTIVITY BASED PARADIGM. The Ultimate still has activities, sure, but it concept has been crippled beyond recognition. Specifically, on the Harmony One+ you could define 'favorite channels' which would appear on the screen so you didn't have to remember the channel number for every thing - FOR EACH ACTIVITY. If you had two 'Watch TV' activities, you would have two sets of favorites. Example: you might have a 'Watch Cable TV' activity and a 'Watch Free-to-Air' Activity - each with its own channel changing mechanism (Cable box or TV) and each with its own channel numbers of course.The Ultimate does not allow this, there is one set of 50 favorites that you can associate with one 'Watch TV' activity. If you are in some other activity and accidently press one of your favorites, it will terminate your current activity and switch to that 'Watch TV' activity. This is NOT the behaviour we have come to expect from our Harmony remote where the programming hides the complexity and the buttons, all the buttons whether software or hardware, apply properly in the context of the activity we are using.The disastrous effect of this designed functionality transforms the Harmony range from head and shoulders above all the rest of the 'Universal Remote' into an expensive, beautiful, well made but 'Ultimately' flawed run of the mill remote.\", 'NN')]\n",

I received this remote as a courtesy replacement for my old Harmony One remote whose battery failed and leaked which I credit Logitech support for. But, that doesn't change that fact that I'd kill to have my old One back instead of this. Tech manufactures need to learn that adding a touch screen just because you can and because you can call it premium is a terrible business strategy.List of problems:1. Ergonomics - Bad button placement. The playback controls are bizarrely placed at the top of the remote, which in this DVR age, is a awful place for some very highly used buttons. The power button is very close and nearly indistinguishable from the rewind button which means about every other day I accidentally turn my system off, very frustrating. No hard page up/down buttons means you need to use the clunky gesture system.2. Touch Screen - This a low quality, unresponsive touch screen. These are common on devices where touchscreens are superfluous like thermostats and printers, but since it's a integral part of how you're expected to use this device it's a big problem. Swiping and tapping are touchy and laggy. Gestures are hit or miss. I understand why they wanted to add this since it allows them to combine the number pad, favorites list, activities, device controls and custom buttons into a single control but it makes using all these items, especially the number pad, a poor experience.3. Battery life - My 650 lasts 6-9 months on a set of batteries. My 880 would last for 2+ months on a single charge. My One would last for 4-5 weeks on a single charge. This new Ultimate One only lasts 5-7 DAYS on a single charge. It's really dismal and my device count and usage has actually decreased in the last couple years making this extra surprising, all in all a bad trend.4. Setup Software - This has always been a problem with these remotes and it's not better with this version. The software works and you only need to live with it rarely, so it's not damning, but this really should be much better. It needs a re-write from the ground up with a focus on usability and efficiency.I'm thinking that I may be abandoning the Harmony line in the not to distant future. It's a shame.\", 'NN')]\n",

If you're a TiVo user, it's a real pain in the keyster, but I think I've worked out some customizations that make it pretty usable.First, I reprogrammed the Direction Right and Direction Right buttons on the center wheel to correspond to TiVo Advance and TiVo Replay, respectively. I left the Long Press function on the buttons alone, so I can long press right or left to use the Guide. It's a compromise, but I really need the Replay and Advance features under my thumb where they belong, so this works well for me.Next, I reprogrammed the Exit button to Zoom on short press. This is a much more convenient way to expand to full screen if you're looking at the DVR guide or list. The long press will invoke TiVo Clear by default, allowing you to delete shows in your list.If you're a TiVo Bolt user (which I am), I reprogrammed the Yellow button on the right to do a sequence of Play and Select (this toggles Quick Play on and off). Quick Play is great for watching sports and longer shows at 30 faster speed with adjusted audio. It can sound a bit like Alvin and the Chipmunks, but it works well (especially for football where audio really isn't important anyway).Also for Bolt users, I reprogrammed the Green button on the far right to correspond to the D button on the new remote...this invokes Commercial Skip. As not all shows support Commercial Skip, I set up a sequence of four Advance (30-sec skip) presses for the long press on the green button...that way I can get kinda-sorta commercial skip functionality even when it's not there (also works for non-Bolt users).Using these mods, I almost never use the transport buttons on the top, which results in far less dropped remotes, inadvertent touchscreen presses, and cursing/thrown remotes.

(I couldn't just replace the battery since it was bulging and stuck in the remote.) The Ultimate One remote itself works just fine once it is configured, but there are plenty of things that I still don't like about the remote.I have problems getting the MyHarmony software to work at all most of the time and I'm not really sure what I've done to get it to work the few times it has worked. It usually just sits there on the splash screen on the computer and doesn't do anything. Once I got the remote configured it works but the button layout is atrocious. Once in the software, I feel like this newer software isn't as easy to configure as the older version that I used in the past.The way the remote sits naturally in your hand, the most accessible part of the remote is the touch screen which is also the most useless part of the remote since you have to look at it to do anything. I like having the screen there when I need it, but nearly everything I use the remote for can be done via the physical buttons. The only well positioned buttons are the directional pad, ok, volume, channel, and menu. The exit button is ok too but I'd rather have something more useful in that spot like previous channel. The fast forward, play/pause, and rewind buttons are what I probably use the most with my DVR recordings and you have to hold the remote in a weird way bridging the gap over the LCD screen while making sure to not hit the LCD screen at all. The info and previous channel buttons near the very bottom are the worst positioned buttons though since they are near the very bottom of the remote and you have to be careful not to drop the remote when going for either of those buttons.I don't really miss the number pad that much like I thought I would but Logitech should have made it feel more natural to hold the remote at the very bottom by putting the battery bump right at the very bottom. They also needed to leave the LCD panel at the very top of the remote with just the power button above it and the other more used buttons all below the screen.

Again, note that according to Logitech's current website, that package is no longer offered, but if you like this remote and think you'll need or use the hub, I'd recommend this package, as best I can tell, it is the same remote but with the addition of the hub for less then the price of the two were you to buy them individually, like I did. Oh well.Second, the Harmony compatibility site is pretty excellent. Just tell it the manufacturer and model number of your equipment and it will tell you pretty much everything you need to know. What can be controlled, what can't and which Harmony products you'll need. Comprehensive database of compatible devices, to say the least.Third, much has been said of the MyHarmony desktop software. Overall, I thought it was fine. Relatively easy to use, but you can tell it's a work in progress, as it's not quite as slick and polished as the interface on the remote itself. However, while you may end up going in a couple of circles, the software does always seem to realize what changes you've made and will ultimately guide you where you need to be. It seems smart enough to realize that some users may do things in a different order based on their specific hardware, and it catches up so to speak to ensure your remote and hub if you have one, are kept in sync. I don't think you need to be an expert to use it, but I could see where some on the lower end of the techno-savvy scale might not understand or have difficulty. My overall feeling though, is that if you're considering this line of products in the first place, you'll be fine with the software.Sidebar for a bit on the Harmony Home Hub. Logitech 915-000238 Harmony Home Hub for Smartphone Control of 8 Home Entertainment and Automation Devices The Ultimate One remote is infrared only. So, if you have any devices that require control via Bluetooth like my PS3 or Wii U, you'll need this Hub if you want to control them with the remote. (You can apparently also use the smartphone app once you have the Hub, but I haven't tried that, and don't really have any intention either. Still, nice to know it's there.) You add the Hub to your profile in the MyHarmony desktop software, and there are a couple of ways to do this, either by upgrading your remote with a hub, or by setting it up as a new Harmony device, but both methods will get you there. Again, the software will realize that installing the Hub as a new device, or upgrading the remote is the same thing, and will route you through the required steps regardless of how you do it. If you buy both, set up the remote first, then add the Hub. Once set up, the remote will have for example your activity named Play PS3 and will signal the Hub to provide the Bluetooth signal to power on the PS3. Works great.Fourth, ergonomics and usability. Lot of talk about the ergos and usability of this remote. Have to say, I honestly find the negative reviews quite surprising. In use, this is one of the best pieces of consumer tech I've ever purchased. Works exactly as promised and way, way more of a pleasure to use than a number of the reviews here make it out to be. A big part of this is the operation and behavior of the screen. It's not like your smartphone's screen prone to accidental brushes and taps. It takes an appropriately deliberate touch to activate anything, and each intentional press is confirmed by a nice little haptic feedback buzz (vibration) to let you know you what you wanted was selected.Also, and why this is rarely mentioned is beyond me, but the screen defaults to a lock screen. Meaning it lights up, but won't register a touch or press until you swipe to unlock it. In use, let's say you're watching TV and the remote is just sitting there asleep. You get up to do something or want to pause or even record to your DVR using the hardware buttons. You can absolutely use those keys without inadvertently touching something on the screen, and the screen will remain locked out. There is apparently a setting where you can turn the lock screen feature off, but I'm not sure why you would want to, as it completely removes the issue of interference by your hand. And again, it's not like an errant brush of the hand will cause an unwanted key selection anyway.On top of that, the screen features a slick gestures screen that slides up from the bottom and allows you to pause, play, volume up and down, fast forward and rewind simply by sweeping your finger or tapping the screen without ever having to look down. Again, this too works exceptionally well. The gestures screen will persist too, meaning if you slide it up to activate it, then set the remote down and it goes back to sleep. as soon as you pick it up again, the gestures screen is still there. I find myself leaving that screen open most of the time, as it's truly simple and intuitive to use.A lot has been made of how un-ergonomic this remote is, and I just don't get that, at all. In use it works extremely well, and I really do not think Logitech committed any massive deign errors. Rather it seems very well thought out and super clever.The Activities, as you set them up via the desktop application just plain work. It is fun to watch everything turn on and set themselves to the correct inputs. And even if for some reason they won't, the remote will guide you through how to fix them, which, when I read about that, I didn't really understand, until I saw it in action myself. First time I went to use my Play PS3 activity, the PS3 did not power up. The remote asked if everything came on, I told it no, it asked what device didn't, I selected PS3, and it popped up a little tutorial on how to pair the Harmony Hub with the PS3. Took maybe two minutes to pair the two and then worked perfectly. Very helpful and simple.Navigating the screens is easy, and there are only a handful of them. Dedicated home, favorites, and settings keys around the screen get you back to where you want to be immediately. Spend ten minutes using it and I promise you'll have it down pat. For every Activity or mode if you will, the controls on screen and the physical buttons assume the roles of the equipment you are currently using. For example, my Watch TV activity means I'm controlling my DirecTV receiver and the volume through my Sony amp. Therefore, the actions available on the screen and the physical buttons assume those roles. (By the way, I find the hardware keys absolutely perfect for controlling the DirecTV receiver.) Likewise, I can choose my Watch SmartTV activity, and it will bring up the apps on my TV and let me select whatever app I want with the physical keys, while the touchscreen displays my SmartTV control selections. Same with PS3, Wii, Xbox, etc. As you cycle through your modes, the remote seamlessly offers you the appropriate control options. Pretty cool indeed.Fifth, I'm not sure why battery life is such a concern. It comes with a charging cradle, seems like a no-brainer to me that when you're not using the remote, just pop it in the cradle, no Assuming most of us have to work and kids- if you have them- are in school, there has to be at least some portion of your day where you can let the remote charge up, right When you're sleeping maybe Just doesn't seem like this should be much of a concern. Longer term, I hope the non-removable battery lasts a good long while, but I'm not too worried about it.Finally, I've been more than pleasantly surprised by how well this works. Granted, I'm a smart remote neophyte, and as with any review take this review with a grain or two of salt, but I really and truly found this to be an exceptional product plus a fun grown up toy to boot. Unless you have equipment that really cannot be controlled by the Harmony products, I can't think of any major reason why I wouldn't recommend this. It's not inexpensive per se, especially if you need the Hub as well, but for as well as it works and the capability it offers, I think it's a good value.\", 'NN')]\n",

Also, in order to upload the configuration I needed to download the new MyHarmony software, instead the older software. The good thing is that I was able to migrate all the configuration from my Harmony One. However, after the migration, not all configuration was perfectly in place, for example, some of the buttons were not working, or not there anymore, so I needed to manually configure them again (not perfect).This remote is based on its touchscreen display, I am trying to get used to it, since my Harmony One had more 'analog' buttons. This one of the disavantages (I think): I was used to feel the buttons and never look at them when I needed to press anything. With this remote I need to look at the display every time I need to change channels. However you can include your favorite channels as your main screen, which makes sense since I noticed I usually watch a half dozen channels.If you are a newbie with a Harmony remote you may find some difficulties with programming, but since I have already owned a previous model, I think it is a very good remote, but a little worse than older models.\", 'NN')]\n",

The BluLink was designed specifically for the PS3 and pre-programmed. It could control up to 5 other devices.

You have to keep it aimed at the devices for the duration of this process or everything won\\'t wind up working (something won\\'t turn on, you\\'ll get the wrong channel, etc). It is \"one-button\" control, but it\\'s far from instantaneous. Also, If you plan to use it with a PS3 (or I assume PS4, XBOX, etc), it isn\\'t directly compatible.

There are several serious drawbacks. First, the remote is rechargeable and that\\'s great if you have an outlet to plug into at your favorite chair, otherwise, the battery dies without warning. It at least should have a low battery alert that gets your attention. There are times it seems to loose functionality while it still looks active, apparently when losing the charge. Doesn\\'t turn on all the devices, (and won\\'t repeat a command, see below). Secondly, it is awkward to impossible to use with one hand. The touchscreen must be reached across for some controls and can be touched inadvertently. The remote has an odd shape and is not comfortable. Third, if you use the remote to turn something on, it will not repeat the same command without first choosing another command. If for any reason the device changes conditions, such as the input source, from the condition the remote left it in, you must turn it all off, or choose another command before you can reuse the first. You may think it is \"locked up\". Even though the touchscreen can be inadvertently touched causing an unwanted command, choosing by touching is not that easy, especially numbers. It has a vibration feedback that takes some getting used to but you better learn to use it or you will have many missed touch commands. Lastly, it does not play well with a \"DirectvReady\" TV when operated using that feature. Using Logitech instructions, you can get some functionality, but plan on a slow process of training individual buttons to individual commands. Considering the awkwardness of the remote, it soon became not worth the trouble. Logitech\\'s technical support was useless in helping understand or resolve the problems. If you are technically savvy, you can probably do it yourself, but the original remote will be nearby in my experience. Even when trained, the time it takes for the TV to show a picture when choosing to \"Watch TV\" with the \"DirectvReady\" as the input, is painfully slow while the TV searches for a Genie etc.Also, the complexity of a smart tv with all the menu options makes using the remote more trouble than it is worth. So, it\\'s great for having replaced several remotes and simplifying commands such as turning on and controlling a CD changer and surround sound system. But the functionality and usability for a smart TV and \"DirectvReady\" (operates as a Direct TV \"mini\") is a drawback. There simply are not enough named button choices for it to be intuitive to use easily. I can only recommend it for the ability to turn on the right devices for a particular function, such as listen to the radio or watch a DVD.
